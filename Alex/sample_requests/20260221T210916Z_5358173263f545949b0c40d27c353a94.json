Let me break down their requirements.\n\nFirst, they mentioned multi-case automation, so the prompt needs to cover different scenarios. Triage, auto-resolution for simple issues, escalation for complex ones, and performance tracking are key elements.\n\nHmm, need to make sure all these points are included without going over the word limit. Maybe start with \"Design a workflow\" to keep it active and concise. Then list the steps in order: triage, auto-fix, escalate, track.\n\nWait, is \"managed hosting provider\" necessary? The user specified it, so yes, include that context. Keep it flowing naturally without cramming too many details. Check the word count... okay, under 40. That should cover everything they asked for."
