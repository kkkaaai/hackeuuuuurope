          "reasoning_content": "First, I need to generate a single-sentence prompt in plain English. The prompt should describe an operational optimization task for a wind-turbine farm. The task must include:\n\n- Analyzing live data\n\n- Adjusting parameters within safety constraints\n\n- Monitoring results\n\n- Reporting performance improvements\n\nThe prompt should be under 40 words. I need to output only the prompt text.\n\nLet me outline the key elements:\n\n1. Operational optimization task for a wind-turbine farm.\n\n2. Includes analyzing live data.\n\n3. Adjusting parameters within safety constraints.\n\n4. Monitoring results.\n\n5. Reporting performance improvements.\n\nI need to combine these into one sentence that is concise and under 40 words.\n\nStart by drafting a sentence: \"Optimize wind-turbine farm operations by analyzing live data, adjusting parameters within safety limits, monitoring outcomes, and reporting performance gains.\"\n\nNow, count the words: Optimize (1), wind-turbine (2), farm (3), operations (4), by (5), analyzing (6), live (7), data (8), adjusting (9), parameters (10), within (11), safety (12), limits (13), monitoring (14), outcomes (15), and (16), reporting (17), performance (18), gains (19). So 19 words. That's under 40, but let me ensure it covers all points.\n\nI used \"safety limits\" instead of \"safety constraints\" – that's fine. \"Monitoring outcomes\" is similar to \"monitoring results.\" \"Reporting performance gains\" covers reporting performance improvements.\n\nI should make sure it's a prompt, so it should be instructive. Since it's a prompt, it might start with something like \"Describe a task to...\" but the user said \"prompt describing an operational optimization task,\" so I think the prompt itself should describe the task. However, in context, this might be a prompt for an AI or a system, so it should be a directive.\n\nThe user said: \"Generate one single-sentence plain-English prompt describing an operational optimization task...\" So the prompt is the description. But typically, a prompt is something you give to an AI or a person to perform a task. So, I need to phrase it as a task description.\n\nLet me see the example from the user's request: \"output only the prompt text\" – so I should just output the sentence.\n\nRefining the sentence: \"Optimize wind-turbine farm performance by analyzing live data, adjusting operational parameters safely, monitoring results, and reporting improvements.\"\n\nWord count: Optimize (1), wind-turbine (2), farm (3), performance (4), by (5), analyzing (6), live (7), data (8), adjusting (9), operational (10), parameters (11), safely (12), monitoring (13), results (14), and (15), reporting (16), improvements (17). 17 words.\n\nI missed \"within safety constraints\" – \"safely\" might imply that, but to be explicit, I should include \"within safety constraints.\" Let me adjust.\n\n\"Optimize wind-turbine farm operations through live data analysis, parameter adjustments within safety constraints, result monitoring, and performance improvement reporting.\"\n\nWord count: Optimize (1), wind-turbine (2), farm (3), operations (4), through (5), live (6), data (7), analysis (8), parameter (9), adjustments (10), within (11), safety (12), constraints (13), result (14), monitoring (15), and (16), performance (17), improvement (18), reporting (19). 19 words.\n\nThat covers all elements: analyzing live data (live data analysis), adjusting parameters within safety constraints, monitoring results (result monitoring), and reporting performance improvements (performance improvement reporting).\n\nI think this works. Let me ensure it's a single sentence and under 40 words. Yes, it is.\n\nI'll go with this."
