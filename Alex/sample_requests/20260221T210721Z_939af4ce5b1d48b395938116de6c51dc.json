          "reasoning_content": "First, the task is to generate a single-sentence prompt in plain English. The prompt should describe an end-to-end content campaign task in the healthcare space. It must include specific elements: research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals.\n\nKey components to cover:\n- End-to-end content campaign: This means the entire process from start to finish.\n- Healthcare space: The context is healthcare.\n- Research: Initial investigation or study.\n- Multi-format content creation: Creating content in various formats like articles, videos, infographics, etc.\n- Consistency across channels: Ensuring the content is uniform across different platforms like social media, websites, email, etc.\n- Measurable goals: Objectives that can be quantified, such as engagement rates, lead generation, etc.\n\nThe prompt must be under 45 words. I need to count the words carefully.\n\nNow, I need to craft a single sentence that incorporates all these elements. Let me try a draft:\n\n\"Develop a healthcare content campaign that involves thorough research, creating diverse content formats, maintaining brand consistency across all channels, and achieving specific measurable outcomes.\"\n\nLet me check the word count: Develop (1), a (2), healthcare (3), content (4), campaign (5), that (6), involves (7), thorough (8), research (9), creating (10), diverse (11), content (12), formats (13), maintaining (14), brand (15), consistency (16), across (17), all (18), channels (19), and (20), achieving (21), specific (22), measurable (23), outcomes (24). That's 24 words, which is under 45. But I need to ensure it's end-to-end. The phrase \"end-to-end\" isn't explicitly stated, but \"campaign\" might imply it. However, the prompt says \"end-to-end content campaign task,\" so I should include \"end-to-end\" to be precise.\n\nRevised draft: \"Create an end-to-end healthcare content campaign requiring research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals.\"\n\nWord count: Create (1), an (2), end-to-end (3), healthcare (4), content (5), campaign (6), requiring (7), research (8), multi-format (9), content (10), creation (11), consistency (12), across (13), channels (14), and (15), measurable (16), goals (17). That's 17 words.\n\nBut is \"multi-format content creation\" clear? It might be better to say \"creating content in multiple formats.\" However, to save words, \"multi-format content creation\" is concise.\n\nAlso, \"consistency across channels\" is good. \"Measurable goals\" is fine.\n\nI need to ensure it's a single sentence. Yes, both drafts are single sentences.\n\nThe instruction says \"output only the prompt text,\" so I should just provide the prompt without any additional explanation.\n\nFinal prompt: \"Create an end-to-end healthcare content campaign that involves research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals.\"\n\nLet's confirm word count: Create, an, end-to-end, healthcare, content, campaign, that, involves, research, multi-format, content, creation, consistency, across, channels, and, measurable, goals. That's 18 words. Under 45, so it's fine.\n\nI could make it more natural: \"Develop a comprehensive healthcare content campaign from research to measurement, ensuring multi-format content and consistency across all channels with clear goals.\"\n\nWord count: Develop, a, comprehensive, healthcare, content, campaign, from, research, to, measurement, ensuring, multi-format, content, and, consistency, across, all, channels, with, clear, goals. That's 21 words. This includes \"from research to measurement\" which implies end-to-end, and it covers all elements.\n\nBut the original specification says \"end-to-end,\" so I'll stick with including that term.\n\nI think the first draft is acceptable. To make it more precise: \"Design an end-to-end healthcare content campaign encompassing research, multi-format content creation, cross-channel consistency, and measurable objectives.\"\n\nWord count: Design, an, end-to-end, healthcare, content, campaign, encompassing, research, multi-format, content, creation, cross-channel, consistency, and, measurable, objectives. That's 16 words.\n\nI'll go with this: \"Design an end-to-end healthcare content campaign encompassing research, multi-format content creation, cross-channel consistency, and measurable objectives.\"\n\nThis includes all required elements and is concise."
