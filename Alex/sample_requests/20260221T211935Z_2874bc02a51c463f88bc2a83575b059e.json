Let me break down their requirements.\n\nFirst, it needs to be under 45 words. The task involves research and analysis, so I should focus on the core elements: gathering from multiple sources, synthesizing insights, handling uncertainty, and producing a structured deliverable.\n\nI can start with a clear action verb like \"Create.\" Mention the subject, say, \"a policy brief.\" Then include the key components: uncertainty analysis, synthesis of multiple reports. Need to specify the goal, maybe adaptation pathways for a specific sector. \n\nMake sure it’s concise. Avoid jargon. Check the word count. Maybe try something like: \"Create a policy brief analyzing uncertainty to synthesize multiple reports into prioritized climate adaptation pathways for coastal cities.\" Let me count the words—that’s 17. Should fit. Include all required elements? Gathering sources is implied in synthesizing reports. Uncertainty is addressed. Deliverable is the policy brief. Structure is prioritized pathways. Yes, this should work."
