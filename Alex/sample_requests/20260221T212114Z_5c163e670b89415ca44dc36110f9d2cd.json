Let me break down the requirements.\n\nFirst, the task is about pharmaceutical clinical trials, so it needs to be high-stakes and professional. The prompt must include structured analysis, identifying risks or compliance issues, proposing revisions, and delivering both technical and executive summaries. Also, keep it under 45 words.\n\nHmm, how to condense all that into one sentence? Let me start with the core action. Maybe \"Analyze a clinical trial protocol for compliance risks...\" Wait, that’s a start. Need to include structured analysis. How about \"Conduct a structured analysis...\"?\n\nThen, risks and compliance issues. Yes, \"identifying critical compliance risks\" covers that. Proposing revisions—add \"propose revisions to ensure regulatory adherence.\" Finally, summaries: \"and deliver technical and executive summaries.\" Let me check the word count.\n\n\"Conduct a structured analysis of a clinical trial protocol, identifying critical compliance risks, propose revisions to ensure regulatory adherence, and deliver both technical and executive summaries.\" That’s 27 words. Under 45, good. Does it cover all points? Structured analysis? Check. Risks? Check. Revisions? Check. Summaries? Check. Yes, this should work."
