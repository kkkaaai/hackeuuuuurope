          "reasoning_content": "First, the task is to generate a single-sentence prompt in plain English. It should describe a high-stakes professional task in financial audits. The task must involve structured analysis, identifying risks or compliance issues, proposing revisions, and delivering both technical and executive summaries.\n\nKey elements from the user's request:\n- Single sentence: So, it should be one coherent sentence.\n- Plain English: Use simple, clear language.\n- High-stakes professional task in financial audits: The context is financial audits, and it should be something critical.\n- Requires: Structured analysis, identifying risks or compliance issues, proposing revisions, and delivering both technical and executive summaries.\n- Output only the prompt text: I shouldn't add any explanations or extra text.\n- Under 45 words: I need to count the words to ensure it's within this limit.\n\nI need to craft a prompt that encapsulates all these elements. Let me brainstorm a sentence structure.\n\nStart with the action: Perhaps \"Analyze a complex financial audit to...\" or \"Conduct a structured analysis of...\"\n\nInclude the requirements: Identify risks and compliance issues, propose revisions, and deliver summaries.\n\nMake it high-stakes: Use terms like \"critical\" or \"high-stakes\" directly.\n\nEnsure it's under 45 words: I'll draft a sentence and then count the words.\n\nDraft: \"Perform a structured analysis of a high-stakes financial audit to identify risks and compliance issues, propose revisions, and deliver both technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nLet's count the words: Perform (1), a (2), structured (3), analysis (4), of (5), a (6), high-stakes (7), financial (8), audit (9), to (10), identify (11), risks (12), and (13), compliance (14), issues (15), propose (16), revisions (17), and (18), deliver (19), both (20), technical (21), and (22), executive (23), summaries (24). That's 24 words. Under 45, so it fits.\n\nBut is it single sentence? Yes, it's one sentence. Is it plain English? Yes, it uses simple terms. Does it cover all elements? Structured analysis, identifying risks/compliance issues, proposing revisions, delivering technical and executive summaries. High-stakes is included via \"high-stakes financial audit.\"\n\nI could make it more precise. For example, specify that it's for a client or regulatory purpose, but the user didn't ask for that. The current draft seems to meet all criteria.\n\nLet me check if there's a better way to phrase it. Another draft: \"Conduct a critical financial audit analysis to uncover risks and compliance gaps, recommend corrective actions, and present detailed and high-level summaries.\"\n\nWord count: Conduct (1), a (2), critical (3), financial (4), audit (5), analysis (6), to (7), uncover (8), risks (9), and (10), compliance (11), gaps (12), recommend (13), corrective (14), actions (15), and (16), present (17), detailed (18), and (19), high-level (20), summaries (21). 21 words. But \"detailed and high-level\" might not explicitly mean technical and executive. I should use \"technical and executive\" as per the user's request.\n\nRefine the first draft: I'll stick with the first draft since it explicitly includes all required elements.\n\nFinal prompt: \"Perform a structured analysis of a high-stakes financial audit to identify risks and compliance issues, propose revisions, and deliver both technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nI think this is good."
