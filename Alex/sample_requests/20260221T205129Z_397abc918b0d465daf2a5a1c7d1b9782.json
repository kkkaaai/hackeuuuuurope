          "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants a single-sentence prompt in plain English. It should describe a multi-case customer support automation workflow for a SaaS startup. The workflow involves triage, automatic resolution of simple issues, escalation of complex cases, and performance tracking.\n\nKey elements to include:\n- Triage: Sorting or prioritizing customer issues.\n- Automatic resolution: Handling simple issues automatically.\n- Escalation: Sending complex cases to human agents.\n- Performance tracking: Monitoring how well the workflow is performing.\n\nThe prompt must be under 40 words. I need to ensure it's concise and fits within that limit.\n\nI'll structure the sentence to flow naturally. Start with the goal or context, then describe the steps.\n\nPossible structure: \"Design a customer support workflow that triages issues, auto-resolves simple ones, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance for a SaaS startup.\"\n\nNow, count the words: \"Design a customer support workflow that triages issues, auto-resolves simple ones, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance for a SaaS startup.\" That's 18 words. Under 40, so it's good.\n\nIs it plain English? Yes, it uses simple terms like \"triages,\" \"auto-resolves,\" \"escalates,\" and \"tracks performance.\"\n\nDoes it cover all elements? Yes: triage, automatic resolution, escalation, and performance tracking. It also specifies \"for a SaaS startup\" as per the user's request.\n\nI should make sure it's a prompt, meaning it's an instruction or request. The user said \"prompt,\" so it should be something like \"Generate...\" or \"Create...\", but since it's describing the workflow, it might be phrased as a command.\n\nThe user said \"prompt describing,\" so the output should be a prompt that describes the workflow. But in context, I think the user wants me to generate a prompt that can be used to create such a workflow. However, the instruction is to output the prompt text itself.\n\nRe-reading: \"Generate one single-sentence plain-English prompt describing a multi-case customer support automation workflow...\" So, I need to write a prompt that describes this workflow. For example, \"Create a customer support automation workflow that includes triage, auto-resolution, escalation, and performance tracking.\"\n\nBut to be precise, I'll go with my initial idea.\n\nFinal check: The prompt should be under 40 words. My draft is 18 words. I can make it even more concise if needed, but it's fine.\n\nI'll output only the prompt text, as specified."
