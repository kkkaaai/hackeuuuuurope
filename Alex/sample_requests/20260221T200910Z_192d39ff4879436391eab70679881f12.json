          "reasoning_content": "First, the task is to generate a single-sentence prompt in plain English. The prompt should describe an operational optimization task for a wind-turbine farm. It must include analyzing live data, adjusting parameters within safety constraints, monitoring results, and reporting performance improvements. Also, the output should be only the prompt text and under 40 words.\n\nI need to condense all these elements into one sentence. Let me list the key components:\n\n1. Analyzing live data\n\n2. Adjusting parameters within safety constraints\n\n3. Monitoring results\n\n4. Reporting performance improvements\n\nThe context is a wind-turbine farm, so I should specify that.\n\nNow, I need to craft a sentence that flows naturally and covers all points. Since it's a prompt, it should be directive, like instructing someone to do this task.\n\nPossible structure: \"Optimize wind-turbine farm operations by analyzing live data, adjusting parameters safely, monitoring outcomes, and reporting performance gains.\"\n\nI need to ensure it's under 40 words. Let me count the words in my draft: \"Optimize wind-turbine farm operations by analyzing live data, adjusting parameters safely, monitoring outcomes, and reporting performance gains.\" That's 12 words. Good.\n\nBut I should check if all elements are included: analyzing live data – yes; adjusting parameters within safety constraints – I said \"adjusting parameters safely,\" which implies within safety constraints; monitoring results – I said \"monitoring outcomes\"; reporting performance improvements – I said \"reporting performance gains.\" All covered.\n\nI can make it more precise. For example, specify \"wind-turbine farm\" or keep it as \"wind farm.\" Since it says \"wind-turbine farm,\" I'll use that.\n\nAnother version: \"To enhance efficiency, analyze live data from the wind-turbine farm, adjust parameters within safety limits, monitor the results, and report any performance improvements.\"\n\nWord count: \"To enhance efficiency, analyze live data from the wind-turbine farm, adjust parameters within safety limits, monitor the results, and report any performance improvements.\" That's 20 words. Still under 40.\n\nBut the prompt should be a single sentence. Both are single sentences.\n\nI need to ensure it's plain English, so avoid jargon. My drafts seem plain enough.\n\nLet me refine to make it more concise: \"Optimize wind-turbine farm operations through live data analysis, safe parameter adjustments, result monitoring, and performance improvement reporting.\"\n\nWord count: 12 words. Yes.\n\nBut is \"safe parameter adjustments\" clear enough for \"within safety constraints\"? I think so. To be explicit, I could say \"adjust parameters within safety constraints,\" but that might make the sentence longer. Since the requirement is to include it, I should explicitly mention safety constraints.\n\nRevised: \"Optimize wind-turbine farm operations by analyzing live data, adjusting parameters within safety constraints, monitoring results, and reporting performance improvements.\"\n\nWord count: 14 words. Perfect.\n\nThis includes all elements: analyzing live data, adjusting parameters within safety constraints, monitoring results, and reporting performance improvements. And it's under 40 words.\n\nI'll go with this."
