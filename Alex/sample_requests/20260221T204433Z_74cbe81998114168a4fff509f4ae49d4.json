Let me break down each part they mentioned.\n\nFirst, I need to include defining requirements, so maybe start with \"Design and implement a new service.\" That sets the stage. Then, building components—adding a REST API fits. Testing and fixing issues could be wrapped into \"write unit/integration tests, debug failures.\" Deploying to an environment needs to be mentioned, so end with \"and deploy it to the staging environment.\" \n\nWait, check the word count: \"Design and implement a new microservice with a REST API for user notifications, write unit/integration tests, debug any failures, and deploy it to the staging environment.\" That's 22 words, under the limit. It covers all the elements the user listed. \n\nMake sure it's realistic for a software engineering task. Yes, notifications are common, and the steps are typical for backend work. No need for extra details, just the plain-English prompt as requested."
