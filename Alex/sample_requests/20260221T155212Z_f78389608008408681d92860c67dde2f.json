They mentioned it needs to cover research, multi-format creation, channel consistency, and measurable goals. Also, under 45 words and in plain English.\n\nFirst, I need to include all four elements without going over the word limit. Maybe start with the research part. \"Research and create a campaign\" could work. Then add the multi-format aspect—specify types like blog posts and videos. \n\nNext, consistency across channels is important. Words like \"coordinated\" or \"unified\" might fit. Finally, measurable goals need a clear outcome, like \"increase enrollment.\" Let me try combining: Research and create blog posts, videos, and emails that work together to boost course sign-ups.\n\nWait, is that under 45 words? Let me count. Yes, it fits. Make sure it flows naturally as one sentence. Maybe adjust \"work together\" to \"form a coordinated campaign\" for better clarity. That should cover all the user’s points."
