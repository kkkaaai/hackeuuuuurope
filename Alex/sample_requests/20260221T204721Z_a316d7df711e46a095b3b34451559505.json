It needs to be realistic, end-to-end, and involve multiple tools, constraint resolution, system updates, and a final outcome. \n\nOkay, keeping it under 40 words means every word counts. Healthcare workflows often involve scheduling, resource allocation, and patient coordination. A surgery scheduling scenario fits well—it requires checking OR availability (tool coordination), resolving surgeon conflicts (constraint), updating EHRs (system updates), and confirming the schedule (final outcome). \n\nThe sentence should flow naturally while hitting all the requirements. Avoiding jargon keeps it plain-English. Let me structure it: action (coordinate), tools (OR, surgeon, EHR), constraint (surgeon’s schedule), updates (EHR), and outcome (surgery confirmed)."
