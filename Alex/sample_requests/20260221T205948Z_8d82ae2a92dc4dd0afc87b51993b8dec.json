The task needs to involve structured analysis, risk identification, compliance checks, revisions, and summaries for both technical and executive audiences. \n\nLet me break it down: aircraft maintenance is the field, high-stakes implies safety or regulatory consequences. Structured analysis suggests a methodical approach. Risk/compliance issues are key. Revisions mean improving something. Dual summaries require tailoring for different readers. \n\nI can craft a sentence that hits all these points without exceeding the word limit. Maybe start with the action, specify the analysis type, mention risks/compliance, include revisions, and end with the dual summaries. \n\nKeeping it plain English is crucial—no jargon. The prompt should flow naturally while packing all required elements."
