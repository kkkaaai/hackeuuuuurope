The key elements are research, multi-format creation, channel consistency, and measurable goals. \n\nI need to pack all those requirements into one concise sentence. Manufacturing is the industry, so mentioning \"industrial machinery manufacturer\" sets the context. \"Multi-channel content campaign\" implies consistency across channels. \"From research to publication\" covers the end-to-end process, and \"aiming to increase qualified leads by 20%\" adds the measurable goal. \n\nThe sentence structure keeps it tight while hitting all the points. Let me check the word count... 39 words, under the limit. The prompt avoids jargon and stays in plain English."
