          "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants a single-sentence plain-English prompt. That means it should be one sentence, in simple English, without jargon.\n\nThe prompt must describe an end-to-end content campaign task in the healthcare space. So, it's about healthcare, and it involves a full campaign from start to finish.\n\nKey elements to include: research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals. I need to ensure all these are covered in the prompt.\n\nThe output should be only the prompt text, and it must be under 45 words. I need to count the words to confirm.\n\nLet me draft a sentence that includes all elements:\n\n- Research: so maybe start with \"Research and create...\"\n- Multi-format content creation: \"multiple formats\" or \"various content types\"\n- Consistency across channels: \"ensure consistency across all channels\"\n- Measurable goals: \"with measurable goals\" or \"to achieve specific metrics\"\n- End-to-end: imply the whole process from research to measurement.\n\nCombine into one sentence: \"Research, create multi-format healthcare content, ensure consistency across channels, and set measurable goals for an end-to-end campaign.\"\n\nThat's 18 words. But let's make it more natural and descriptive.\n\nAnother attempt: \"Develop an end-to-end healthcare content campaign that involves research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals.\"\n\nThat's 22 words. Still under 45.\n\nI can refine it to sound more like a prompt: \"Create a healthcare content campaign from research to measurement, producing multi-format content with channel consistency and clear goals.\"\n\nThat's 20 words.\n\nEnsure it's a single sentence: yes.\n\nPlain-English: avoid technical terms. Keep it simple.\n\nFinal check: \"Generate one single-sentence plain-English prompt...\" so the output is just the prompt text.\n\nI think my second draft is good: \"Develop an end-to-end healthcare content campaign that involves research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals.\"\n\nWord count: \"Develop\" (1), \"an\" (2), \"end-to-end\" (3), \"healthcare\" (4), \"content\" (5), \"campaign\" (6), \"that\" (7), \"involves\" (8), \"research\" (9), \"multi-format\" (10), \"content\" (11), \"creation\" (12), \"consistency\" (13), \"across\" (14), \"channels\" (15), \"and\" (16), \"measurable\" (17), \"goals\" (18). 18 words.\n\nBut \"multi-format\" might be considered one word, but in word count, it's often counted as one. To be precise, I'll count it as one. So 18 words total.\n\nI can make it even more concise: \"Research, create multi-format healthcare content, ensure consistency across channels, and set measurable goals for a complete campaign.\"\n\nThat's 20 words. \"Complete\" instead of \"end-to-end\" but similar meaning.\n\nI'll go with the first one that explicitly says \"end-to-end\" to match the user's description.\n\nOutput only the prompt text: so no additional explanation.\n\nI think this meets all criteria."
