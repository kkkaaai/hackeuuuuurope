          "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants a single-sentence prompt in plain English. It should describe a realistic software engineering task in an ML pipeline. The task must include defining requirements, building components, testing, fixing issues, and deploying to an environment.\n\nKey elements to cover:\n- Defining requirements\n- Building components\n- Testing\n- Fixing issues\n- Deploying to an environment\n\nIt needs to be under 45 words. I should count the words to ensure compliance.\n\nLet me brainstorm a sentence. For example: \"Develop an ML model for customer churn prediction by gathering requirements, building data processing and model training components, testing for accuracy, debugging issues, and deploying to a cloud platform.\"\n\nNow, check if this includes all elements:\n- Defining requirements: implied in \"gathering requirements\"\n- Building components: \"building data processing and model training components\"\n- Testing: \"testing for accuracy\"\n- Fixing issues: \"debugging issues\"\n- Deploying: \"deploying to a cloud platform\"\n\nBut I need to make it a single sentence. The example above is a single sentence, but let's see the word count: \"Develop an ML model for customer churn prediction by gathering requirements, building data processing and model training components, testing for accuracy, debugging issues, and deploying to a cloud platform.\" – that's 24 words. Under 45, so it's fine.\n\nIs it realistic? Yes, customer churn prediction is a common ML task. However, I can make it more specific or general. The prompt should be a task description for someone to follow.\n\nThe user said \"output only the prompt text\", so I shouldn't include any extra explanation. Just the sentence.\n\nLet me refine the sentence to ensure it flows well and covers all aspects concisely.\n\nAlternative: \"Create a sentiment analysis pipeline by specifying requirements, constructing data ingestion and model components, running tests, resolving bugs, and deploying to a production server.\"\n\nWord count: 20 words. Includes all elements.\n\nI should ensure it's in plain English and easy to understand.\n\nFinal decision: I'll go with a version that clearly states all steps.\n\nAnother option: \"Build an image classification system from defining needs and coding modules to testing, fixing errors, and launching on a web service.\"\n\nWord count: 18 words. Covers all points.\n\nBut \"defining needs\" might be synonymous with requirements, and \"coding modules\" for building components. \"Testing\" is there, \"fixing errors\" for fixing issues, and \"launching on a web service\" for deploying.\n\nI think this works.\n\nTo make it more comprehensive: \"Implement a machine learning pipeline for fraud detection that involves requirement analysis, component development, rigorous testing, issue resolution, and final deployment to a live environment.\"\n\nWord count: 22 words. Yes.\n\nI'll choose one that is concise and includes all elements. Let's go with the first one I thought of, but I'll tweak it for clarity.\n\nFinal prompt: \"Develop an ML model for customer churn prediction by defining requirements, building components, testing thoroughly, fixing any issues, and deploying to a cloud environment.\"\n\nWord count: 20 words. Perfect.\n\nI'll output only this sentence."
