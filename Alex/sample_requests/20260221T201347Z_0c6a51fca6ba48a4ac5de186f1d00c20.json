Let me start by identifying the core components: research, multi-format content, cross-channel consistency, and measurable outcomes. \n\nThe education space suggests focusing on a specific topic, like study skills. I can structure it as a campaign task that begins with research, produces various content types, maintains brand voice, and ties to KPIs. \n\nKeeping it under 45 words means avoiding extra details. The sentence should flow naturally while hitting all points. Maybe start with the action (\"Create a campaign...\") and weave in the requirements."
