Let me start by breaking down the original query.\n\nFirst, the user asked for a single-sentence prompt in plain English for a complex climate adaptation task. The requirements included gathering multiple sources, synthesizing insights, handling uncertainty, and producing a structured deliverable, all under 45 words. \n\nI need to ensure the prompt hits all those points. Let me check the provided response: \"Synthesize climate projections, case studies, and cost data into a report that prioritizes coastal adaptation strategies, clearly noting confidence levels for each recommendation.\" That’s one sentence, under 45 words. \n\nNow, does it cover multi-source info? Yes, mentions projections, case studies, and cost data. Synthesis? Turning them into a report with prioritized strategies. Uncertainty? Noting confidence levels. Structured deliverable? A report. Each requirement is addressed concisely. \n\nI should avoid markdown and keep it in plain English. The thinking here is straightforward: identify key elements from the query, map them to the response, and verify word count and structure. No need for extra details—just confirm each point is met."
