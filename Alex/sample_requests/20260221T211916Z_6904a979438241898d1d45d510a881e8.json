They mentioned it needs to be plain English, under 45 words, and cover multiple aspects like gathering info from sources, synthesizing insights, handling uncertainty, and delivering a structured output.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure all those elements are included. Maybe start with the core action, like “Analyze the viability…” to kick things off. Then mention the sources—market reports and consumer data—since they emphasized multiple sources. Synthesis part could be woven in with “synthesize insights” explicitly. Uncertainty handling is key, so including “accounting for competitive and regulatory uncertainty” covers that. Finally, the structured deliverable needs to be clear, so “into a detailed five-year strategic roadmap” should wrap it up.\n\nWait, let me check the word count. The example they gave has 41 words, so under 45. Did I cover everything? Gathering info – check. Synthesizing – check. Uncertainty – check. Structured deliverable – check. The language is straightforward without jargon. Yeah, this should work."
