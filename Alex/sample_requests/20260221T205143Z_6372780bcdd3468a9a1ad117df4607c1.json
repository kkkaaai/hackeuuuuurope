          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let me break down what the user is asking for. They want a single-sentence prompt in plain English about an e-commerce workflow. The workflow needs to be end-to-end, realistic, involve multiple tools, have a constraint to resolve, include system updates, and end with a final outcome. Also, it has to be under 40 words.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure the prompt covers all these elements without being too verbose. E-commerce workflows often involve inventory, orders, payments, and notifications. Coordinating tools could mean linking an inventory system with a payment gateway and a CRM. A constraint might be stock availability or payment failure.\n\nUpdating systems could involve adjusting inventory levels or order status. The final outcome is usually delivering the product or confirming the order. Let me draft something that ties these together smoothly.\n\nHow about: “A customer places an order, which triggers an inventory check, processes payment, updates the order status, and notifies the warehouse for shipping, resolving any stock or payment issues along the way.” That’s 29 words. It includes tools (inventory, payment systems, notification), a constraint (stock or payment issues), updates (order status), and outcome (shipping). Yeah, that fits."
