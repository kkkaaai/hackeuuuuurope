Let me break down their requirements: managed hosting provider, triage, automatic resolution for simple issues, escalation for complex cases, and performance tracking.  \n\nI need to combine all these elements concisely. Start with the workflow steps: triage first, then automation for simple issues, escalation for complex ones. Finally, include tracking for efficiency.  \n\nKeeping it under 40 words means avoiding extra details. Maybe structure it as a command: \"Create a workflow that...\" or \"Design a system...\" Wait, the example uses \"Design a system...\" That flows well. Let me check the word count. \"Design a system that triages hosting support tickets, auto-resolves common issues, escalates complex cases, and tracks resolution performance.\" That’s 19 words. Perfect.  \n\nDid I miss anything? Triage, auto-resolution, escalation, tracking—all covered. The phrasing is direct and fits the user’s plain-English request. No jargon, just clear steps. Yeah, this should work."
