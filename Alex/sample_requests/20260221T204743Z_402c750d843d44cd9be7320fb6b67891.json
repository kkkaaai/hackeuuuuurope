          "reasoning_content": "First, the prompt must be a single sentence in plain English. It should describe an operational optimization task for a wind-turbine farm. The task needs to include:\n\n1. Analyzing live data\n\n2. Adjusting parameters within safety constraints\n\n3. Monitoring results\n\n4. Reporting performance improvements\n\nThe output should only be the prompt text, and it must be under 40 words.\n\nI need to craft a concise sentence that covers all these elements. Let me list the key points:\n\n- Operational optimization task for a wind-turbine farm\n\n- Analyze live data\n\n- Adjust parameters within safety constraints\n\n- Monitor results\n\n- Report performance improvements\n\nNow, I'll try to combine these into one sentence. I need to ensure it's under 40 words. Let me draft a few versions.\n\nDraft 1: \"Optimize wind-turbine farm operations by analyzing live data, adjusting parameters safely, monitoring outcomes, and reporting performance gains.\"\n\nWord count: 12 words. That covers all points, but let me check if it's clear and includes all elements.\n\n- Analyze live data: yes\n\n- Adjust parameters within safety constraints: \"adjusting parameters safely\" implies within safety constraints, but I could make it more explicit. However, to save words, \"safely\" might suffice.\n\n- Monitoring results: \"monitoring outcomes\" is similar.\n\n- Reporting performance improvements: \"reporting performance gains\" works.\n\nThis is under 40 words, so it should be fine. But let me see if I can make it more natural.\n\nDraft 2: \"To optimize a wind-turbine farm, analyze live data, adjust parameters within safety limits, monitor the results, and report any performance improvements.\"\n\nWord count: 18 words. Still under 40.\n\nI think Draft 1 is more concise, but Draft 2 is more explicit. However, the instruction says \"plain-English prompt,\" so it should be clear and straightforward.\n\nI'll go with a version that is concise and includes all elements. Let me count the words carefully.\n\nFinal draft: \"Optimize wind-turbine farm operations by analyzing live data, adjusting parameters within safety constraints, monitoring results, and reporting performance improvements.\"\n\nWord count: 14 words. Yes, this includes all four elements explicitly.\n\nIs \"within safety constraints\" clear? Yes, it means adjusting parameters while adhering to safety limits.\n\nAlso, \"monitoring results\" and \"reporting performance improvements\" are directly mentioned.\n\nI think this meets the requirements. Now, I need to output only the prompt text, so I'll write that sentence."
