          "reasoning_content": "First, the user asks for a single-sentence plain-English prompt. That means it should be one sentence, in simple English, without technical jargon or complex structure.\n\nThe prompt needs to describe a realistic software engineering task in backend microservices. So, I should focus on a task related to microservices, which are small, independent services that work together in a backend system.\n\nThe task must include defining requirements, building components, testing, fixing issues, and deploying to an environment. I need to ensure all these elements are covered in the sentence.\n\nThe output should only be the prompt text, and it must be under 45 words. I need to count the words to make sure.\n\nLet me brainstorm a task. A common microservices task might be creating a new service for user authentication, or handling payment processing, or managing inventory. I'll pick something generic but realistic.\n\nI need to incorporate all the steps: defining requirements, building components, testing, fixing issues, and deploying. Since it's a single sentence, I have to weave these into a coherent description.\n\nTry to draft a sentence: \"Develop a user authentication microservice by gathering requirements, implementing endpoints, conducting unit and integration tests, debugging failures, and deploying to a staging environment.\"\n\nNow, check the elements:\n\n- Defining requirements: \"gathering requirements\" covers that.\n\n- Building components: \"implementing endpoints\" implies building the service components.\n\n- Testing: \"conducting unit and integration tests\" covers testing.\n\n- Fixing issues: \"debugging failures\" covers fixing issues.\n\n- Deploying: \"deploying to a staging environment\" covers deployment.\n\nBut is this realistic? Yes, for backend microservices, authentication is a common task.\n\nCount the words: \"Develop a user authentication microservice by gathering requirements, implementing endpoints, conducting unit and integration tests, debugging failures, and deploying to a staging environment.\" That's 20 words. Under 45, so good.\n\nIs it a single sentence? Yes, it's one sentence with a series of actions.\n\nIs it plain English? Yes, it uses simple terms without overly technical language.\n\nI could make it more specific or varied, but this seems to fit all criteria.\n\nEnsure it's under 45 words: I'll count again: Develop (1), a (2), user (3), authentication (4), microservice (5), by (6), gathering (7), requirements (8), implementing (9), endpoints (10), conducting (11), unit (12), and (13), integration (14), tests (15), debugging (16), failures (17), and (18), deploying (19), to (20), a (21), staging (22), environment (23). So 23 words. Perfect.\n\nThe user said \"output only the prompt text\", so I should just provide the sentence without any additional explanation.\n\nFinalize the prompt: \"Develop a user authentication microservice by gathering requirements, implementing endpoints, conducting unit and integration tests, debugging failures, and deploying to a staging environment.\""
