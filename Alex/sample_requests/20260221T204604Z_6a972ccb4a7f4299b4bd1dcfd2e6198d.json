Let me break down the requirements.\n\nFirst, it needs to be under 45 words, plain English, and describe a high-stakes professional task. The task involves structured analysis, identifying risks or compliance issues, proposing revisions, and delivering technical and executive summaries.\n\nI should focus on clinical trials since that's specified. Maybe mention a key document like a trial protocol or regulatory submission. Need to include all elements: analysis, risk/compliance, revisions, and both summaries.\n\nLet me draft something concise. \"Analyze a clinical trial protocol\" covers the structured part. Then \"identify compliance gaps and risks\" includes risk/compliance. \"Propose amendments\" handles revisions. Finally, \"deliver both technical and executive summaries\" wraps it up. Check the word count... that's 17 words, fits."
