Let me break down the requirements: it needs to cover triage, automatic resolution, escalation, and performance tracking for a managed hosting provider.\n\nI should start by identifying the key components: triage to categorize issues, auto-fix for simple problems, escalation for complex cases, and analytics for tracking. The challenge is fitting all that into one sentence under 40 words.\n\nMaybe structure it as a flow: triage incoming tickets, resolve common ones automatically, escalate others, and monitor the system’s performance. That covers all points without extra details. Let me check the word count—yes, this should fit."
