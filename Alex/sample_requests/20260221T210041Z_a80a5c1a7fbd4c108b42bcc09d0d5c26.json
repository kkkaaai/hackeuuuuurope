The key requirements are: end-to-end description, includes research, multi-format creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals. Need to keep it under 45 words in plain English.\n\nLet me break down the elements: healthcare space, research phase, creating different content formats, maintaining brand consistency across platforms, and tying it to measurable outcomes. \n\nI can structure it as a directive task starting with \"Create a...\" to imply end-to-end ownership. Then pack in the components: research, multi-format content, cross-channel consistency, and measurable KPIs. \n\nKeeping it under 45 words means being economical - using phrases like \"content campaign\" to encompass the workflow, \"aligned assets\" for consistency, and \"trackable KPIs\" for measurability. The healthcare context should be explicit but not verbose."
