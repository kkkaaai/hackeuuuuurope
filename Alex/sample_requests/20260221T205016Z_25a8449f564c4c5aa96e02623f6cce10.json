          "reasoning_content": "First, the task is to generate a single-sentence prompt in plain English. It should describe a complex research and analysis task in supply-chain resilience. The task must involve:\n\n1. Gathering information from multiple sources.\n\n2. Synthesizing insights.\n\n3. Handling uncertainty.\n\n4. Producing a structured deliverable.\n\nThe prompt should be under 45 words. I need to output only the prompt text.\n\nKey elements to include:\n\n- Focus on supply-chain resilience.\n\n- Complexity: it's a research and analysis task.\n\n- Multiple sources: imply data from different places.\n\n- Synthesizing insights: combining information to form conclusions.\n\n- Handling uncertainty: dealing with incomplete or ambiguous data.\n\n- Structured deliverable: like a report, plan, or framework.\n\nI need to condense this into one sentence that flows naturally. Let me brainstorm some ideas.\n\nExample starting points:\n\n- \"Analyze supply-chain resilience by collecting data from various sources, integrating findings to manage uncertainties, and creating a detailed report.\"\n\nBut that's a bit straightforward. I should make it more engaging and specific to supply-chain resilience.\n\nPossible prompt: \"Research supply-chain vulnerabilities from multiple datasets, synthesize risk insights while accounting for uncertainties, and produce a structured resilience assessment report.\"\n\nCount the words: \"Research supply-chain vulnerabilities from multiple datasets, synthesize risk insights while accounting for uncertainties, and produce a structured resilience assessment report.\" That's 18 words. Under 45, so good.\n\nBut is it complex enough? It mentions vulnerabilities, risk insights, and resilience assessment. It covers gathering (from multiple datasets), synthesizing (risk insights), handling uncertainty (accounting for uncertainties), and structured deliverable (resilience assessment report).\n\nI can refine it to sound more professional. Let me try another version.\n\n\"Conduct a comprehensive analysis of supply-chain resilience by aggregating data from diverse sources, synthesizing key insights to address uncertainties, and delivering a structured mitigation plan.\"\n\nWord count: \"Conduct a comprehensive analysis of supply-chain resilience by aggregating data from diverse sources, synthesizing key insights to address uncertainties, and delivering a structured mitigation plan.\" That's 22 words.\n\nBoth are under 45 words. I need to ensure it's a single sentence. Both are single sentences.\n\nI should check if they explicitly mention all requirements. The original instruction says: \"gathering information from multiple sources, synthesizing insights, handling uncertainty, and producing a structured deliverable.\"\n\nIn my first attempt: \"multiple datasets\" implies multiple sources; \"synthesize risk insights\" covers synthesizing insights; \"accounting for uncertainties\" covers handling uncertainty; \"produce a structured resilience assessment report\" covers structured deliverable.\n\nSimilarly, in the second: \"aggregating data from diverse sources\" for gathering; \"synthesizing key insights\" for synthesizing; \"to address uncertainties\" for handling uncertainty; \"delivering a structured mitigation plan\" for structured deliverable.\n\nI think either works, but I'll choose one that flows best. Let's aim for clarity and conciseness.\n\nFinal prompt: \"Analyze supply-chain resilience by gathering data from multiple sources, synthesizing insights to manage uncertainty, and producing a structured assessment report.\"\n\nWord count: 18 words. It covers all points.\n\nI can make it slightly more detailed without exceeding 45 words. For example: \"Research and analyze supply-chain resilience through multi-source data collection, insight synthesis to handle uncertainties, and creation of a structured deliverable like a resilience framework.\"\n\nBut that's a bit clunky. I'll stick with a cleaner version.\n\nI think the key is to ensure it sounds like a prompt for a complex task. Using words like \"comprehensive\" or \"in-depth\" might help.\n\n\"Perform an in-depth analysis of supply-chain resilience by collecting information from various sources, integrating findings to navigate uncertainties, and compiling a structured strategic report.\"\n\nWord count: 21 words.\n\nAll versions are under 45 words. I need to output only one prompt.\n\nLet's go with a balanced one: \"Conduct a complex research task on supply-chain resilience that involves gathering multi-source information, synthesizing insights to address uncertainties, and producing a structured deliverable.\"\n\nWord count: 20 words. This directly mirrors the instruction but in a coherent sentence.\n\nTo make it more natural: \"Research supply-chain resilience by gathering data from multiple sources, synthesizing insights to handle uncertainty, and producing a structured analysis report.\"\n\nThat's 18 words. I think this is fine.\n\nI'll finalize with: \"Analyze supply-chain resilience through multi-source data gathering, insight synthesis to manage uncertainties, and creation of a structured assessment report.\"\n\nWord count: 16 words.\n\nYes, this works."
