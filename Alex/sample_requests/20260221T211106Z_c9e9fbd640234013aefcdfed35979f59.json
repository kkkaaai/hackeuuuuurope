Let me break down the requirements.\n\nFirst, it needs to be end-to-end operational, so covering from start to finish. Multiple tools must be coordinated, like inventory systems or production software. There’s also at least one constraint to resolve, maybe material shortages or scheduling conflicts.\n\nUpdating systems is another point—perhaps adjusting inventory or production logs after resolving the constraint. The final outcome should be clear, like delivering a finished product. \n\nKeeping it under 40 words means being concise. Avoiding jargon, using plain English. Maybe a scenario involving part shortages, coordinating procurement and production, updating inventory, and shipping the final product. \n\nLet me check the word count. Ensure it flows naturally as one sentence. Make sure all elements are included without being overly detailed."
