The task needs to cover the full lifecycle: requirements, building, testing, bug-fixing, and deployment. \n\nOkay, keeping it under 45 words means every word must count. I can structure it as a direct instruction starting with an action verb. \"Develop\" covers the initial building phase. \"Define requirements first\" sets the preliminary step. \"Test thoroughly\" and \"fix bugs\" handle the quality assurance cycle. Finally, \"deploy to staging\" completes the deployment requirement. \n\nThe phrase \"a new user profile editor\" makes it concrete and realistic for a mobile app context. The sentence flows naturally while hitting all the requested checkpoints."
