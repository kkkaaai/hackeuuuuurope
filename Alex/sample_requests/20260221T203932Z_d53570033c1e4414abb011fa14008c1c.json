Let me break down their requirements.\n\nFirst, they mentioned triage, automatic resolution of simple issues, escalation of complex cases, and performance tracking. I need to include all these elements concisely.\n\nHmm, starting with \"Design a workflow\" sets the action. \"Triage incoming tickets\" covers the first part. Then, adding \"automatically resolve common issues\" handles the simple fixes. For escalation, maybe \"route complex ones to agents\" works. Finally, including \"track performance metrics\" satisfies the tracking aspect.\n\nLet me count the words. \"Design a workflow to triage incoming tickets, automatically resolve common issues, route complex ones to agents, and track performance metrics.\" That’s 19 words, fits under 40. Check if all key points are covered: triage, auto-resolution, escalation, and tracking. Yes, all there. Should keep it plain English without jargon. Looks good."
