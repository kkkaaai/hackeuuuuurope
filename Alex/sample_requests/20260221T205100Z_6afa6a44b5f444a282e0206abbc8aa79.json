Let me start by breaking down the original query.\n\nFirst, the query asks for a single-sentence prompt in plain English about a high-stakes task in aircraft maintenance. It needs to include structured analysis, risk identification, compliance issues, revisions, and both technical and executive summaries. Also, the prompt must be under 45 words.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the elements required: analysis, risks/compliance, revisions, and two types of summaries. High-stakes professional context means it should involve critical scenarios like airworthiness or safety. \n\nI need to ensure the prompt is concise. Starting with the action verb \"Analyze\" to kick off structured analysis. Mentioning \"aircraft maintenance procedures\" sets the context. Including \"risks and compliance gaps\" covers the identification part. \"Propose corrective revisions\" addresses the revisions. Finally, \"technical report and executive summary\" fulfills the dual output requirement. \n\nChecking the word count: \"Analyze aircraft maintenance procedures for risks and compliance gaps, propose corrective revisions, and deliver both a technical report and executive summary.\" That's 22 words. Fits under 45. Yes, it hits all the points without extra fluff."
