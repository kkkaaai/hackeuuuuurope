They specified it should be in plain English, under 40 words, and include analyzing live data, adjusting parameters safely, monitoring results, and reporting improvements.\n\nI need to ensure all these elements are covered concisely. First, I'll start with the core action: \"Analyze real-time sensor data.\" Then incorporate parameter adjustments: \"adjust conveyor speeds and routing.\" Safety constraints are crucial, so I'll add \"within safe operating limits.\" Monitoring and reporting can be combined into \"monitor throughput and report efficiency gains.\"\n\nLet me count the words. That's about 22 words, which fits under 40. The sentence flows naturally and hits all the points without being too technical. It’s a straightforward instruction that anyone familiar with warehouse operations could follow."
