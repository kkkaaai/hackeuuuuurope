The key requirements are: realism, multi-tool coordination, constraint resolution, system updates, and a final outcome—all under 40 words. \n\nFintech has many possible scenarios, but fraud alerts are a common multi-step process. Let’s structure it around a suspicious transaction: detection triggers a freeze, investigation requires cross-referencing data, resolving the alert involves customer contact, and the outcome updates both fraud and billing systems. \n\nThis fits the word limit while hitting all the required elements—tools (fraud system, CRM, billing), constraint (legitimate transaction vs. fraud), updates (unfreeze/flag), and outcome (processed/blocked payment)."
