Let me break down the requirements.\n\nFirst, the key elements mentioned are triage, automatic resolution of simple issues, escalation of complex cases, and performance tracking. Need to make sure all these are included concisely.\n\nKeeping it under 40 words is crucial. Maybe start with the workflow steps: triage, auto-resolve, escalate. Then add performance tracking as an outcome. \n\nAvoid technical jargon since it's plain English. Use active verbs like \"route,\" \"resolve,\" \"escalate,\" and \"track\" to keep it dynamic. \n\nCheck the word count: \"Design a customer support workflow that routes inquiries, resolves simple ones automatically, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance metrics.\" That’s 20 words. Should fit the user’s request."
