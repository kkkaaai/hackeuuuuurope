          "reasoning_content": "First, the task is to generate a single-sentence prompt in plain English. It should describe an operational optimization task for an HVAC building system. The prompt needs to include analyzing live data, adjusting parameters within safety constraints, monitoring results, and reporting performance improvements.\n\nKey elements from the instruction:\n- Single sentence.\n- Plain English.\n- Under 40 words.\n- Include: analyzing live data, adjusting parameters within safety constraints, monitoring results, reporting performance improvements.\n\nI need to combine these into a coherent sentence. Let me list out the components:\n1. Analyzing live data\n2. Adjusting parameters within safety constraints\n3. Monitoring results\n4. Reporting performance improvements\n\nThe prompt should be for an operational optimization task. So, I should phrase it as a directive or a description of what to do.\n\nI aim to keep it concise and under 40 words. Let me draft a sentence:\n\n\"Analyze live HVAC data, adjust parameters safely, monitor outcomes, and report performance gains.\"\n\nThat's a start. Let's count the words: Analyze, live, HVAC, data, adjust, parameters, safely, monitor, outcomes, and, report, performance, gains. That's 13 words. But I need to ensure it includes all elements. \"Safely\" implies within safety constraints, but I should make it explicit. Also, \"performance gains\" might be too vague; \"performance improvements\" is better.\n\nRevised draft: \"Analyze live HVAC data, adjust parameters within safety constraints, monitor results, and report performance improvements.\"\n\nWord count: Analyze, live, HVAC, data, adjust, parameters, within, safety, constraints, monitor, results, and, report, performance, improvements. That's 15 words. Still under 40, so good.\n\nBut is this a complete prompt? It's a bit simplistic. I should make it sound more like a task description. Perhaps: \"Optimize HVAC operations by analyzing live data, adjusting parameters within safety limits, monitoring outcomes, and reporting performance improvements.\"\n\nWord count: Optimize, HVAC, operations, by, analyzing, live, data, adjusting, parameters, within, safety, limits, monitoring, outcomes, and, reporting, performance, improvements. That's 18 words.\n\nI need to ensure it's a single sentence. Both drafts are single sentences.\n\nThe instruction says \"output only the prompt text under 40 words.\" So, I should just provide the prompt without any additional text.\n\nI'll choose the most concise version that covers all points. Let me check if \"safety constraints\" or \"safety limits\" is better. \"Safety constraints\" is more precise, but \"limits\" is shorter. Since word count is low, I can use \"constraints.\"\n\nFinal prompt: \"Optimize HVAC system performance by analyzing live data, adjusting parameters within safety constraints, monitoring results, and reporting improvements.\"\n\nWord count: Optimize, HVAC, system, performance, by, analyzing, live, data, adjusting, parameters, within, safety, constraints, monitoring, results, and, reporting, improvements. That's 17 words.\n\nYes, this includes all elements: analyzing live data, adjusting parameters within safety constraints, monitoring results, and reporting performance improvements (I used \"improvements\" instead of \"performance improvements,\" but \"performance\" is implied from \"HVAC system performance\").\n\nTo be explicit, I could say \"reporting performance improvements,\" but that might make it longer. In the context, \"improvements\" likely refers to performance improvements.\n\nI think this works. Let me ensure it's under 40 words: definitely.\n\nSo, I'll output this prompt."
