          "reasoning_content": "First, the prompt needs to be a single sentence in plain English. It should describe an end-to-end content campaign task in the fintech space. The task must involve research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals.\n\nKey elements to include:\n- Fintech space: so related to financial technology.\n- End-to-end content campaign: meaning from start to finish, covering all stages.\n- Research: initial investigation or analysis.\n- Multi-format content creation: creating content in various formats like blogs, videos, infographics, etc.\n- Consistency across channels: ensuring the message is uniform across different platforms (e.g., social media, website, email).\n- Measurable goals: objectives that can be quantified, such as engagement metrics, leads generated, etc.\n\nI need to output only the prompt text, and it must be under 45 words.\n\nLet me draft a sentence that incorporates all these elements.\n\nDraft 1: \"Create a fintech content campaign that starts with market research, produces blogs and videos, maintains brand voice everywhere, and aims to increase user sign-ups by 20%.\"\n\nCheck elements:\n- Fintech content campaign: yes.\n- Research: \"market research\" covers that.\n- Multi-format content creation: \"blogs and videos\" – but is that multi-format? It could include more, but for brevity, this might suffice. I can say \"various formats\" to be broader.\n- Consistency across channels: \"maintains brand voice everywhere\" implies consistency.\n- Measurable goals: \"increase user sign-ups by 20%\" is measurable.\n- End-to-end: \"starts with market research\" implies beginning, but does it cover end-to-end? I should ensure it implies the entire process.\n\nWord count: 20 words. Under 45, so good.\n\nBut let's see if I can make it more comprehensive. Perhaps specify \"end-to-end\" explicitly.\n\nDraft 2: \"Develop an end-to-end fintech content campaign involving research, creating multi-format content, ensuring consistency across all channels, and achieving measurable goals like lead generation.\"\n\nElements:\n- End-to-end: included.\n- Fintech: included.\n- Research: included.\n- Multi-format content: \"creating multi-format content\" is clear.\n- Consistency across channels: \"ensuring consistency across all channels\" is good.\n- Measurable goals: \"achievable measurable goals like lead generation\" – but \"achievable\" might be redundant. \"Measurable goals\" is sufficient.\n\nWord count: 21 words. Still good.\n\nI need to make sure it's a single sentence. Both drafts are single sentences.\n\nLet me refine to be more concise and natural.\n\nFinal draft: \"Design a comprehensive fintech content campaign that includes research, produces various content formats, ensures cross-channel consistency, and targets specific measurable outcomes.\"\n\nCheck elements:\n- Comprehensive implies end-to-end.\n- Fintech content campaign: yes.\n- Research: included.\n- Produces various content formats: covers multi-format creation.\n- Ensures cross-channel consistency: good.\n- Targets specific measurable outcomes: covers measurable goals.\n\nWord count: 18 words. Under 45.\n\nIs it under 45 words? Yes.\n\nI'll go with this."
