          "reasoning_content": "First, the task is to generate a single-sentence plain-English prompt. It should describe a high-stakes professional task in pharmaceutical clinical trials. The task must involve structured analysis, identifying risks or compliance issues, proposing revisions, and delivering both technical and executive summaries.\n\nKey elements from the user's request:\n- Single sentence.\n- Plain-English.\n- Describe a high-stakes professional task in pharmaceutical clinical trials.\n- The task requires: structured analysis, identifying risks or compliance issues, proposing revisions, and delivering both technical and executive summaries.\n- Output only the prompt text.\n- Under 45 words.\n\nI need to craft a prompt that incorporates all these elements concisely. Let me brainstorm what this task might be. In pharmaceutical clinical trials, high-stakes tasks could involve reviewing clinical trial protocols, assessing safety reports, or evaluating regulatory submissions. But specifically, it should involve structured analysis, risk identification, compliance issues, proposing revisions, and delivering summaries.\n\nFor example, a task could be: \"Analyze a clinical trial protocol for risks and compliance, propose revisions, and provide technical and executive summaries.\" But I need to make it more engaging and precise.\n\nLet me ensure it's a single sentence and under 45 words. I'll count the words as I draft.\n\nDraft 1: \"Review the clinical trial protocol for structured analysis, identify risks and compliance issues, propose revisions, and deliver both technical and executive summaries.\" This is 22 words, but it might sound a bit repetitive. Also, \"review\" might not fully capture \"structured analysis.\"\n\nDraft 2: \"Conduct a structured analysis of a clinical trial protocol to identify risks and compliance issues, propose revisions, and deliver both technical and executive summaries.\" This is 24 words. Better, but I can make it more specific to high-stakes.\n\nDraft 3: \"Perform a high-stakes structured analysis of a clinical trial protocol, identifying risks and compliance issues, proposing revisions, and delivering both technical and executive summaries.\" This is 22 words. \"High-stakes\" is included, but is it clear that it's a professional task? The prompt should describe the task, so it's implied.\n\nThe user said \"describing a high-stakes professional task,\" so the prompt should be something like: \"You are tasked with...\" but since it's a prompt, I can phrase it directly.\n\nI think the prompt should be in the form of an instruction to someone, like: \"Analyze the clinical trial data for structured insights, identify risks and compliance gaps, propose corrective actions, and provide technical and executive summaries.\" But that might not specifically mention pharmaceutical clinical trials.\n\nTo make it explicitly about pharmaceutical clinical trials, I should include that context.\n\nFinal draft: \"Analyze a pharmaceutical clinical trial protocol through structured analysis to identify risks and compliance issues, propose revisions, and deliver both technical and executive summaries.\" This is 24 words.\n\nLet me check if it covers all elements: high-stakes? I didn't use \"high-stakes\" explicitly, but \"pharmaceutical clinical trials\" implies high-stakes. The user said \"high-stakes professional task,\" so I should include \"high-stakes\" to be safe.\n\nRevised: \"Conduct a high-stakes structured analysis of a pharmaceutical clinical trial protocol, identifying risks and compliance issues, proposing revisions, and delivering both technical and executive summaries.\" This is 25 words. Good.\n\nI need to ensure it's a single sentence. Yes, this is one sentence. Under 45 words? Yes, 25 words.\n\nNow, output only the prompt text. So, I'll write that sentence.\n\nBut let me see if I can make it more natural. Perhaps: \"Perform a structured analysis of a high-stakes clinical trial protocol to identify risks and compliance issues, propose revisions, and deliver technical and executive summaries.\" That's 24 words. Still fine.\n\nI think the key is to include all required actions: structured analysis, identifying risks/compliance, proposing revisions, delivering summaries.\n\nI'll go with: \"Conduct a structured analysis of a pharmaceutical clinical trial protocol to identify risks and compliance issues, propose revisions, and deliver both technical and executive summaries.\" This is 24 words.\n\nTo emphasize high-stakes: \"Execute a high-stakes structured analysis of a clinical trial protocol, identifying risks and compliance issues, proposing revisions, and delivering technical and executive summaries.\" 22 words.\n\nI think this meets the criteria."
