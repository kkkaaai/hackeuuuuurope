Let me break down the requirements: it needs to include requirements definition, component building, testing, bug fixing, and deployment, all in one sentence under 45 words.\n\nOkay, mobile app development... realistic scenario... maybe focus on a common feature like notifications. That touches multiple areas: defining how notifications work, building the UI and backend, testing, fixing bugs, and deploying. \n\nKeep it simple and action-oriented. Start with the core task, then list the key phases without being too technical. Need to ensure all five elements are covered naturally. \n\nHow about: \"Build a notification system for the app by defining specs, coding UI and logic, running tests, debugging failures, and releasing to the staging server.\" Yes, that hits all points and stays under the word limit."
