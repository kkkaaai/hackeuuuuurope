It needs to include research, multi-format creation, cross-channel consistency, and measurable goals. \n\nLet me break it down: fintech is the niche, end-to-end means covering all stages. Research comes first, then creating different content types, ensuring brand voice aligns everywhere, and ending with tracking performance. \n\nI can structure it as a directive task: start with the action verb \"Design,\" specify the research phase, list the content formats briefly, mention channel alignment, and end with the goal measurement. Need to keep it concise but cover all elements. \n\nOkay, this version hits the key points within the word limit: \"Design a fintech content campaign from market research to producing blogs, videos, and social posts that maintain a consistent brand voice and track engagement metrics.\""
