          "reasoning_content": "First, the prompt needs to be a single sentence in plain English. It should describe a high-stakes professional task in health data privacy. The task must involve structured analysis, identifying risks or compliance issues, proposing revisions, and delivering both technical and executive summaries.\n\nThe output should only be the prompt text, and it must be under 45 words. I need to count the words carefully.\n\nLet me break down the requirements:\n\n- **High-stakes professional task**: Something critical, like ensuring compliance with regulations or protecting sensitive data.\n\n- **Health data privacy**: This involves personal health information, so things like HIPAA compliance, data breaches, or privacy policies.\n\n- **Structured analysis**: A methodical approach to examining the situation.\n\n- **Identifying risks or compliance issues**: Spotting potential problems or violations.\n\n- **Proposing revisions**: Suggesting changes to improve security or compliance.\n\n- **Delivering both technical and executive summaries**: Providing detailed reports for technical staff and high-level overviews for executives.\n\nI need to condense all this into one sentence under 45 words.\n\nPossible prompt: \"Analyze our health data privacy framework to identify compliance gaps and risks, propose corrective measures, and provide both technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nLet me count the words: Analyze (1), our (2), health (3), data (4), privacy (5), framework (6), to (7), identify (8), compliance (9), gaps (10), and (11), risks (12), propose (13), corrective (14), measures (15), and (16), provide (17), both (18), technical (19), and (20), executive (21), summaries (22). That's 22 words. Under 45, so it fits.\n\nBut is it high-stakes? Implicitly, health data privacy is always high-stakes, but I can emphasize it. Also, \"structured analysis\" isn't explicitly mentioned, but \"analyze\" implies analysis, and \"framework\" suggests structure. I can make it more explicit.\n\nRevised prompt: \"Conduct a structured analysis of our health data privacy systems to identify risks and compliance issues, propose revisions, and deliver technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nWord count: Conduct (1), a (2), structured (3), analysis (4), of (5), our (6), health (7), data (8), privacy (9), systems (10), to (11), identify (12), risks (13), and (14), compliance (15), issues (16), propose (17), revisions (18), and (19), deliver (20), technical (21), and (22), executive (23), summaries (24). 24 words.\n\nThis covers all elements: structured analysis, identifying risks/compliance issues, proposing revisions, and delivering summaries. It's also high-stakes because health data privacy systems are critical.\n\nI think this works. Let me ensure it's under 45 words. Yes, 24 is well under.\n\nFinally, output only the prompt text. So, I'll write the prompt without any additional explanation."
