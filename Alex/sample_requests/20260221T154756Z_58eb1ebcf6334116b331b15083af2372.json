          "reasoning_content": "First, the task is to generate a single-sentence prompt in plain English. It must describe an end-to-end content campaign task in the fintech space. The prompt should include elements like research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals.\n\nKey components to cover:\n- End-to-end content campaign: This means the entire process from start to finish.\n- Fintech space: Financial technology, so the content should be related to that industry.\n- Research: Initial investigation or analysis.\n- Multi-format content creation: Creating content in various formats like blogs, videos, infographics, etc.\n- Consistency across channels: Ensuring the message is uniform across different platforms (e.g., social media, website, email).\n- Measurable goals: Objectives that can be quantified, such as engagement metrics, leads, etc.\n\nThe prompt must be under 45 words. I need to count the words carefully.\n\nI should write a concise sentence that incorporates all these elements. Since it's a prompt, it should be instructive or descriptive, like something you'd give to a content team.\n\nPossible structure: \"Create a fintech content campaign that involves researching [topic], producing multi-format content, maintaining consistency across channels, and achieving measurable goals such as [specific metrics].\"\n\nBut I need to make it a single sentence and under 45 words.\n\nLet me draft a few options:\n\n1. \"Develop an end-to-end fintech content campaign including research, creating various content formats, ensuring brand consistency across all channels, and setting measurable performance goals.\"\n\nWord count: 20 words. Good, but I can make it more specific.\n\n2. \"Plan and execute a fintech content campaign that starts with research, produces multi-format content, maintains consistency across channels, and defines measurable goals for success.\"\n\nWord count: 24 words. Still under 45.\n\n3. \"Design a comprehensive fintech content strategy involving market research, multi-format content creation, cross-channel consistency, and measurable objectives to track campaign effectiveness.\"\n\nWord count: 22 words. This covers all points.\n\nI need to ensure it's a single sentence. All my drafts are single sentences.\n\nThe prompt should be in plain English, so avoid jargon. Fintech might be considered jargon, but it's commonly understood in context.\n\nI think option 3 is clear and concise. Let's verify the word count: \"Design a comprehensive fintech content strategy involving market research, multi-format content creation, cross-channel consistency, and measurable objectives to track campaign effectiveness.\" – Words: Design, a, comprehensive, fintech, content, strategy, involving, market, research, multi-format, content, creation, cross-channel, consistency, and, measurable, objectives, to, track, campaign, effectiveness. That's 21 words.\n\nBut in the original instruction, it says \"output only the prompt text under 45 words.\" So I should just provide the prompt without any additional text.\n\nAlso, the prompt should describe a task, so it might be phrased as an instruction. For example, \"Create a fintech content campaign that involves research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals.\"\n\nThat's 18 words: Create, a, fintech, content, campaign, that, involves, research, multi-format, content, creation, consistency, across, channels, and, measurable, goals. Yes, 18 words.\n\nBut is \"end-to-end\" included? In this version, it's implied by \"campaign,\" but I should explicitly mention it to match the requirement. The requirement says \"end-to-end content campaign task,\" so I need to include that.\n\nRevised: \"Develop an end-to-end fintech content campaign task encompassing research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals.\"\n\nWord count: 16 words: Develop, an, end-to-end, fintech, content, campaign, task, encompassing, research, multi-format, content, creation, consistency, across, channels, and, measurable, goals. Yes, 16 words.\n\nThis covers all elements: end-to-end, fintech, research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals. It's a single sentence and under 45 words.\n\nI think this is sufficient. Let me double-check if it's clear and in plain English. Yes, it seems straightforward.\n\nFinal prompt: \"Develop an end-to-end fintech content campaign task encompassing research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals.\"\n\nI'll output this."
