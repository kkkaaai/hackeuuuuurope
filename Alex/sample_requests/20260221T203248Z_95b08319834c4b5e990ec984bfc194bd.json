Let me break down the key elements: realistic, end-to-end operational workflow, manufacturing domain, coordinating multiple tools, resolving at least one constraint, updating systems, and delivering a final outcome. The prompt must be under 40 words.\n\nOkay, manufacturing workflows often involve production lines, quality checks, inventory, and scheduling. A common scenario could be addressing a machine failure or material shortage. Coordinating tools might include maintenance systems, inventory databases, and scheduling software. Resolving a constraint could involve rerouting production or sourcing alternative materials. Updating systems would involve logging repairs, adjusting inventory, and rescheduling orders. The final outcome should be resumed production and updated records.\n\nMaybe a prompt about a production line halt due to a faulty component. That would require coordinating maintenance, inventory, and scheduling tools, resolving the part shortage constraint, updating maintenance logs and inventory systems, and delivering the outcome of resumed production. Let me check the word count. Yes, that fits under 40 words."
