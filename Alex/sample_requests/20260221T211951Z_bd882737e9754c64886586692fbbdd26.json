          "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants a single-sentence prompt in plain English. That means it should be straightforward and easy to understand, without jargon.\n\nThe prompt must describe an end-to-end content campaign task in the manufacturing space. So, it should be specific to manufacturing, like something about industrial processes, products, or services.\n\nThe task involves research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals. I need to include all these elements in one sentence.\n\nResearch: This could mean market research, product research, or industry analysis.\n\nMulti-format content creation: This might include blog posts, videos, infographics, social media posts, whitepapers, etc.\n\nConsistency across channels: Ensuring that the message is uniform across different platforms like website, social media, email newsletters.\n\nMeasurable goals: Such as increasing brand awareness, generating leads, improving engagement, or boosting sales.\n\nNow, I need to combine all this into a single sentence under 45 words. Let me draft a sentence.\n\nDraft: \"Create a content campaign for a manufacturing client that includes research, produces various content formats, maintains consistency across all channels, and sets measurable goals for success.\"\n\nCount the words: \"Create a content campaign for a manufacturing client that includes research, produces various content formats, maintains consistency across all channels, and sets measurable goals for success.\" – That's 25 words. Under 45, so good.\n\nBut is it end-to-end? The user said \"end-to-end,\" which might imply from planning to execution and measurement. My draft covers the elements, but I should ensure it sounds comprehensive.\n\nMaybe rephrase to emphasize the end-to-end aspect. For example: \"Develop an end-to-end content campaign for manufacturing that involves research, creating multiple content types, ensuring channel consistency, and defining measurable outcomes.\"\n\nWord count: \"Develop an end-to-end content campaign for manufacturing that involves research, creating multiple content types, ensuring channel consistency, and defining measurable outcomes.\" – 18 words.\n\nThat covers all the points: research, multi-format content creation (multiple content types), consistency across channels (channel consistency), and measurable goals (measurable outcomes). And it's specific to manufacturing.\n\nI think this works. Let me confirm the word count and ensure it's plain English.\n\nFinal prompt: \"Develop an end-to-end content campaign for manufacturing that involves research, creating multiple content types, ensuring channel consistency, and defining measurable outcomes.\"\n\nYes, that should do."
