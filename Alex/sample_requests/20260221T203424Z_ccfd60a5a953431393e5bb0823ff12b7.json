          "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants a single-sentence prompt in plain English. It should describe a multi-case customer support automation workflow for a retail chain. The workflow includes triage, automatic resolution of simple issues, escalation of complex cases, and performance tracking.\n\nKey elements to include:\n- Triage: Sorting or prioritizing customer issues.\n- Automatic resolution: Handling simple issues automatically.\n- Escalation: Sending complex cases to human agents.\n- Performance tracking: Monitoring how well the system is working.\n\nThe prompt must be under 40 words. I need to ensure it's concise and covers all these aspects in one sentence.\n\nStructure the sentence: Start with the goal or action. For example: \"Design a customer support automation workflow that...\"\n\nCombine the elements: Triage, auto-resolve, escalate, track performance.\n\nDraft a sentence: \"Create a workflow that triages customer issues, auto-resolves simple ones, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance for a retail chain's support system.\"\n\nCount the words: \"Create a workflow that triages customer issues, auto-resolves simple ones, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance for a retail chain's support system.\" – That's 20 words. Under 40, so it's fine.\n\nMake sure it's plain English: Yes, it uses simple terms.\n\nCheck if it's a prompt: The user said \"generate one single-sentence plain-English prompt,\" so this should be a prompt that someone could use to instruct or describe the workflow. Since it's describing the workflow, it might be used as a specification or instruction.\n\nRefine for clarity: Perhaps specify \"retail chain customer support\" to be more precise.\n\nAlternative: \"Design an automated support workflow for a retail chain that triages cases, resolves simple issues automatically, escalates complex ones, and tracks performance metrics.\"\n\nWord count: \"Design an automated support workflow for a retail chain that triages cases, resolves simple issues automatically, escalates complex ones, and tracks performance metrics.\" – 18 words.\n\nBoth are similar. I'll go with the second one as it flows better.\n\nEnsure it's under 40 words: Yes.\n\nFinal output: Only the prompt text, no additional explanation."
