          "reasoning_content": "First, the task is to generate a single-sentence plain-English prompt. It must describe an end-to-end content campaign task in the manufacturing space. The campaign should involve research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals. The output should only be the prompt text and be under 45 words.\n\nI need to craft a sentence that includes all these elements: research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals, all within the manufacturing industry.\n\nLet me break down the requirements:\n\n- **End-to-end content campaign task**: This means the entire process from start to finish.\n\n- **In the manufacturing space**: So, it should be related to manufacturing, like industrial processes, machinery, supply chain, etc.\n\n- **Involves research**: This could be market research, audience research, or topic research.\n\n- **Multi-format content creation**: Creating content in various formats like blog posts, videos, infographics, whitepapers, etc.\n\n- **Consistency across channels**: Ensuring the message is uniform across different platforms like website, social media, email newsletters.\n\n- **Measurable goals**: Having specific objectives that can be tracked, such as leads generated, website traffic, or engagement metrics.\n\nNow, I need to combine these into a single sentence that is concise and under 45 words. I should avoid any extra text or explanations since the output is only the prompt text.\n\nLet me draft a sentence:\n\n\"Develop a manufacturing content campaign that includes research, creates multiple content formats, maintains consistency across all channels, and achieves measurable goals.\"\n\nThat's 20 words. Let me check if it covers everything:\n\n- End-to-end: Implied by \"campaign.\"\n\n- Manufacturing space: Specified.\n\n- Research: Included.\n\n- Multi-format content creation: \"creates multiple content formats.\"\n\n- Consistency across channels: \"maintains consistency across all channels.\"\n\n- Measurable goals: \"achieves measurable goals.\"\n\nIt seems to cover all points. But I can make it more specific or natural. Perhaps: \"Create an end-to-end content campaign for manufacturing that involves research, multi-format content creation, channel consistency, and measurable objectives.\"\n\nThat's 18 words. Still good.\n\nI need to ensure it's under 45 words. Both drafts are well under that limit.\n\nLet me refine it to sound more like a prompt: \"Design a comprehensive manufacturing content campaign with research, diverse content formats, consistent messaging across channels, and clear, measurable goals.\"\n\nThat's 16 words. I think this works.\n\nTo make it more task-oriented: \"Plan and execute a manufacturing content campaign that includes research, multi-format content, cross-channel consistency, and defined metrics.\"\n\nThat's 15 words.\n\nI'll choose one that is clear and includes all elements. The prompt should be in plain English, so I'll avoid jargon.\n\nFinal prompt: \"Develop an end-to-end manufacturing content campaign involving research, creating multiple content formats, ensuring consistency across channels, and setting measurable goals.\"\n\nWord count: 18 words. Under 45, so it's fine.\n\nI'll output only this text."
