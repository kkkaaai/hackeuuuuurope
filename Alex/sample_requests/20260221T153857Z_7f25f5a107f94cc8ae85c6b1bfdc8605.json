Output only the prompt text (no extra formatting, no quotes unless part of the prompt)\n5. Under 40 words\n\nLet me draft a few options:\n\nOption 1: Analyze live delivery data to adjust fleet routing parameters within safety limits while monitoring real-time results and reporting performance improvements to stakeholders. (19 words)\n\nOption 2: Continuously analyze live traffic and vehicle data to optimize delivery routes within safety constraints, monitor outcome metrics, and report efficiency gains to management. (21 words)\n\nOption 3: Review real-time fleet data to calibrate delivery parameters safely, track operational outcomes, and document performance improvements for the autonomous vehicle network. (18 words)\n\nOption 4: Monitor live autonomous vehicle data to adjust operational settings within safety protocols, observe delivery outcomes, and communicate efficiency improvements to the team. (19 words)\n\nOption 5: Analyze real-time delivery fleet data to optimize vehicle parameters within safety guidelines, track results continuously, and report performance gains to stakeholders.
