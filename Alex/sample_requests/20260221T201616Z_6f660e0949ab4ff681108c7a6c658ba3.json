They specified it needs to be a single sentence in plain English, under 45 words, and include research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure all those elements are covered. Research is essential, so starting with that makes sense. Then multi-format content—maybe mention specific types like blog posts and videos. Consistency across channels should be implied by mentioning a unified campaign. Measurable goals could be tied to lead generation or engagement.\n\nLet me check the word count. \"Research, plan, and execute a unified campaign\" covers research and consistency. \"Producing blog posts, case studies, and videos\" hits multi-format. \"To generate qualified leads\" adds the measurable goal. That’s 24 words—under the limit. It flows as one sentence and stays in plain English. Did I miss anything? The manufacturing space is addressed by context, so maybe it’s implied. Should I specify it’s for manufacturing? The user said \"in the manufacturing space,\" so the prompt already assumes that context. Yeah, this should work."
