          "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants a single-sentence plain-English prompt. That means it should be one sentence, written in simple, everyday language.\n\nThe prompt must describe an end-to-end content campaign task in the manufacturing space. So, it should be focused on manufacturing – maybe things like industrial processes, machinery, supply chain, etc.\n\nThe task involves several elements: research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals. I need to include all these aspects in the prompt.\n\nThe output should only be the prompt text, and it must be under 45 words. I need to count the words to ensure compliance.\n\nLet me draft a prompt that incorporates all these elements:\n\n- Research: Investigating topics, trends, or audience needs in manufacturing.\n\n- Multi-format content creation: Creating different types of content like blog posts, videos, infographics, etc.\n\n- Consistency across channels: Ensuring the content is uniform across websites, social media, email, etc.\n\n- Measurable goals: Setting objectives like lead generation, brand awareness, or engagement metrics.\n\nI'll write a concise sentence that covers all this.\n\nDraft: \"Develop a content campaign for a manufacturing client that includes market research, creating blog posts and videos, maintaining brand voice across all platforms, and aiming to increase lead generation by 20%.\"\n\nWord count: 25 words. That's under 45. But let me check if it covers all elements: research (market research), multi-format (blog posts and videos), consistency (maintaining brand voice across all platforms), measurable goals (increase lead generation by 20%). Yes, it does.\n\nIs it end-to-end? \"Develop a content campaign\" implies from start to finish, so it should cover the entire process.\n\nI can make it more specific to manufacturing. Instead of \"client,\" I could say \"manufacturing company\" to emphasize the space.\n\nRevised draft: \"Create an end-to-end content campaign for a manufacturing company involving research, producing articles and videos, ensuring consistent messaging across channels, and targeting a 15% rise in qualified leads.\"\n\nWord count: 24 words. Still good.\n\nI need to ensure it's a single sentence. Both drafts are single sentences.\n\nThe user said \"plain-English,\" so avoid jargon. My drafts use common terms.\n\nFinal check: Under 45 words? Yes. Includes all elements? Research, multi-format, consistency, measurable goals. Yes.\n\nI'll go with the second draft for precision."
