Need to make it realistic and end-to-end. \n\nHealthcare often involves scheduling, resource constraints, and coordinating between systems. Let's pick a common scenario like a patient procedure. It needs to involve checking availability, resolving conflicts, updating records, and confirming the outcome. \n\nKeeping it under 40 words means cutting unnecessary details. Focus on the core actions: coordinate, check, resolve, update, confirm. The prompt should flow naturally while hitting all required elements. \n\nOkay, how about this: Coordinating a patient's procedure involves checking OR availability, resolving scheduling conflicts, updating both medical and billing records, and confirming the final appointment with the patient. That covers tools, constraints, updates, and outcome."
