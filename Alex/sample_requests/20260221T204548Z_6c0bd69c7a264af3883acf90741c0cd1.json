The key requirements are: end-to-end task, research, multi-format content, cross-channel consistency, and measurable goals. Need to keep it under 45 words.\n\nOkay, let's break it down. \"Education space\" suggests academic or learning topics. \"Research\" implies background work. \"Multi-format\" means articles, videos, etc. \"Consistency across channels\" requires unified messaging. \"Measurable goals\" needs KPIs.\n\nHow about combining all elements? Start with the action verb \"Design\" to imply end-to-end ownership. Specify \"educational product launch\" as the scenario. List research and formats concisely. Mention channel alignment and measurement targets. \n\nCheck word count... 31 words. Yes, that fits. The prompt covers all requested aspects without extras."
