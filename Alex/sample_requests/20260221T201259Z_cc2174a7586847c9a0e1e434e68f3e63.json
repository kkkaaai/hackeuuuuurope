It needs to cover multiple aspects: gathering from various sources, synthesizing insights, handling uncertainty, and delivering a structured output. The prompt must be in plain English and under 45 words.\n\nOkay, I should focus on condensing all these requirements into one fluid sentence. Maybe start with the core task—assessing market entry feasibility—then list the key actions: analyzing multiple data sources, synthesizing findings, accounting for uncertainties, and concluding with a structured recommendation report. \n\nLet me check the word count: \"Assess the feasibility of entering a new market by analyzing multiple data sources, synthesizing insights, accounting for uncertainties, and delivering a structured recommendation report.\" That’s 28 words—fits the limit. Covers all the required elements without fluff."
