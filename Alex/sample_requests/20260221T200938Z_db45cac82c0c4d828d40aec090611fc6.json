Let me break down their requirements.\n\nFirst, it needs to be realistic and end-to-end operational. Maybe something involving production, scheduling, or quality control. They mentioned coordinating multiple tools, so I should include different systems like MES or ERP.\n\nResolving at least one constraint is key. Maybe material shortages or machine downtime. Updating systems like inventory or schedules has to be part of the flow. The final outcome could be a shipped product or updated production plan.\n\nKeeping it under 40 words means being concise. Let me draft: \"When a production line halts due to a missing component, update the inventory system, reschedule orders to prioritize urgent ones, and confirm the revised shipping timeline.\" That covers tools (inventory, scheduling), constraint (missing part), updates, and outcome (timeline). Count the words... 28. Perfect."
