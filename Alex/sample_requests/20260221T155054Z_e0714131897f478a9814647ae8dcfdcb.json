They mentioned including defining requirements, building components, testing, fixing issues, and deploying. Also, it has to be under 45 words and in plain English.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure all elements are covered in one smooth sentence. Maybe start with the overall goal, then list the steps naturally. How about something like: \"Design and implement a model monitoring system that alerts on data drift, requiring you to write the detection logic, validate it with unit tests, debug false positives, and deploy it to the staging environment.\"\n\nLet me check the word count. Yes, that’s under 45. It includes requirements (designing the system), building (writing detection logic), testing (unit tests), fixing (debugging false positives), and deploying. Sounds realistic for an ML engineer’s daily task. Should be good to go."
