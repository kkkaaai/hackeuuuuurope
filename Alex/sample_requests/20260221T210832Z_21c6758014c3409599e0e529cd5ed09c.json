          "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants a single-sentence plain-English prompt. That means it should be one sentence, in simple English, not technical jargon.\n\nThe prompt should describe an operational optimization task for a wind-turbine farm. The task includes four elements:\n\n1. Analyzing live data\n\n2. Adjusting parameters within safety constraints\n\n3. Monitoring results\n\n4. Reporting performance improvements\n\nI need to output only the prompt text, and it must be under 40 words.\n\nSo, I have to craft a sentence that incorporates all these elements concisely.\n\nLet me list the key points:\n\n- Operational optimization task for a wind-turbine farm\n\n- Analyze live data\n\n- Adjust parameters safely\n\n- Monitor results\n\n- Report performance improvements\n\nI need to combine these into one smooth sentence.\n\nPossible structure: \"Optimize wind farm operations by analyzing live data, adjusting parameters within safety limits, monitoring outcomes, and reporting efficiency gains.\"\n\nThat covers all the elements. Now, check the word count: \"Optimize wind farm operations by analyzing live data, adjusting parameters within safety limits, monitoring outcomes, and reporting efficiency gains.\" Let's count: Optimize (1), wind (2), farm (3), operations (4), by (5), analyzing (6), live (7), data (8), adjusting (9), parameters (10), within (11), safety (12), limits (13), monitoring (14), outcomes (15), and (16), reporting (17), efficiency (18), gains (19). 19 words. Under 40, so that works.\n\nBut is \"efficiency gains\" the same as \"performance improvements\"? Probably yes, but to be precise, I can use \"performance improvements\" instead. Let's revise: \"Optimize wind farm operations by analyzing live data, adjusting parameters within safety constraints, monitoring results, and reporting performance improvements.\" Word count: Optimize (1), wind (2), farm (3), operations (4), by (5), analyzing (6), live (7), data (8), adjusting (9), parameters (10), within (11), safety (12), constraints (13), monitoring (14), results (15), and (16), reporting (17), performance (18), improvements (19). Still 19 words.\n\nI used \"safety constraints\" instead of \"safety limits\" to match the user's phrase \"safety constraints.\" Good.\n\nThis sentence includes all the required elements and is under 40 words. It's a single sentence in plain English.\n\nNow, ensure it's a prompt. The user said \"prompt describing an operational optimization task,\" so this should be a directive or instruction. My sentence starts with \"Optimize,\" which is imperative, so it works as a prompt.\n\nFinal check: Is it under 40 words? Yes, 19 words. Is it one sentence? Yes. Is it plain English? Yes, no technical terms. Does it include all elements? Analyzing live data, adjusting parameters within safety constraints, monitoring results, reporting performance improvements. Yes.\n\nI think this is good."
