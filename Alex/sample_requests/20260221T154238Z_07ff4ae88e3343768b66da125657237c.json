Requirements:\n - Single sentence\n - Plain English\n - Involves research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals\n - Under 45 words\n - Output only the prompt text\n \n Let me draft options:\n \n 1. Research fintech trends, create blog posts, videos, and social content with unified messaging across channels, and track KPIs to drive measurable customer acquisition.\n (19 words - good)\n \n 2. Conduct market research to develop consistent whitepapers, blogs, and social media across all platforms with specific ROI targets.\n (17 words - good)\n \n 3. Analyze fintech user data to produce consistent video, email, and blog content across channels while optimizing for conversion metrics.\n (17 words - good)\n \n 4. Research target audiences and develop cohesive webinars, articles, and social posts across channels to achieve specific lead generation goals.\n (17 words - good)\n \n Let me check word counts and ensure all elements are covered:\n - Research: yes\n - Multi-format: yes (whitepapers/blogs/social or video/email/blog, etc.)\n - Consistency across channels: yes\n - Measurable goals: yes (KPIs, ROI targets, conversion metrics, lead generation)\n \n Option 1 seems most comprehensive but let me make sure it's under 45 words... yes, 19 words.\n \n Actually, let me make it more natural:\n \n \"Research emerging payment trends, create blogs, videos, and infographics with consistent branding across channels, and optimize toward measurable conversion KPIs.\"\n \n That's 17 words. Covers:\n - Research (payment trends)\n - Multi-format (blogs, videos, infographics)\n - Consistency (consistent branding across channels)\n - Measurable goals (conversion KPIs)\n \n Or:\n \"Analyze fintech market data to develop consistent whitepapers, podcasts, and social content across platforms while tracking engagement and lead generation metrics.\"\n \n 18 words.\n \n Let me go with something clear and comprehensive:\n \n \"Research fintech customer pain points, create consistent blogs, videos, and social content across channels, and optimize campaign performance against specific lead generation targets.\"\n \n That's 19 words.\n \n Or shorter:\n \"Research fintech trends to develop consistent multi-format content across channels and optimize toward measurable lead generation KPIs.\"\n \n 15 words.
