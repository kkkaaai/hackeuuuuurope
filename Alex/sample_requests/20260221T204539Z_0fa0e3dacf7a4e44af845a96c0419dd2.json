Let me start by breaking down the original query.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand all the requirements. The user specified an end-to-end task involving research, multi-format creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals. The output has to be a single sentence under 45 words. \n\nHmm, the provided response is: \"Create a Q2 campaign for our new athleisure line, starting with market research, then producing blog posts, videos, and social content that share a unified message, aiming to increase online sales by 15%.\" Let me check if this covers all the elements.\n\nResearch is there with \"market research.\" Multi-format content includes blog posts, videos, and social content. Consistency is addressed by \"share a unified message.\" Measurable goals are covered with \"increase online sales by 15%.\" It's one sentence and under 45 words. \n\nThe thought process here would involve identifying each required component and weaving them into a coherent, concise prompt. Starting with the campaign's purpose (Q2, athleisure line), ensuring each specified task is mentioned without extra details, and keeping it within the word limit. Avoiding jargon to keep it plain English."
