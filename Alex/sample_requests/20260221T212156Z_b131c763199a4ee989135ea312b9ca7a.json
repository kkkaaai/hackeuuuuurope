They mentioned analyzing live data, adjusting parameters safely, monitoring results, and reporting improvements.\n\nFirst, I need to cover all those elements concisely. Maybe start with the action, like \"Analyze live conveyor data.\" Then include adjusting parameters within safety constraints. Monitoring results should tie into reporting performance gains.\n\nWait, \"performance improvements\" could be phrased as \"performance gains\" to save words. Also, ensure the sentence flows smoothly without exceeding the word limit. Let me draft it: \"Analyze live conveyor data to safely adjust parameters, monitor results, and report performance gains.\" That’s 14 words, fits the limit, and hits all points."
