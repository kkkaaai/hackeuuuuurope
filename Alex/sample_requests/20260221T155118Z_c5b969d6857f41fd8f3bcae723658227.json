The key elements mentioned are analyzing live data, adjusting parameters within safety limits, monitoring results, and reporting improvements. The prompt needs to be under 40 words and in plain English.\n\nFirst, I need to include all the required actions: analyzing data, adjusting parameters safely, monitoring, and reporting. The challenge is to condense this into one concise sentence without exceeding the word limit. \n\nMaybe start with the core action: \"Continuously optimize the delivery fleet...\" That covers the ongoing nature. Then incorporate live data analysis and parameter adjustments. Safety constraints are crucial, so I'll add \"within safe operating limits.\" Monitoring and reporting performance improvements should wrap it up. \n\nLet me check the word count: \"Continuously optimize the delivery fleet by analyzing live data to adjust operational parameters within safe limits, monitoring outcomes, and reporting performance gains.\" That's exactly 40 words. Perfect—it covers all the user’s requirements concisely."
