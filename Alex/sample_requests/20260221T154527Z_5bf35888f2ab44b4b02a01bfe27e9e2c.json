The prompt needs to cover live data analysis, parameter adjustment within safety limits, monitoring, and reporting improvements, all under 40 words.\n\nOkay, let's break down the requirements: operational optimization, conveyor network, live data analysis, safety constraints, monitoring results, and performance reporting. Need to pack all that into one smooth sentence.\n\nGot it—focus on the core action (\"continuously optimize\") and chain the key steps: analyze data, adjust parameters safely, monitor impact, and report gains. Keeping it under 40 words shouldn’t be hard if I avoid fluff.\n\nThe sentence flows naturally: start with the goal, list the steps in logical order, and end with the outcome. That should cover everything the user asked for."
