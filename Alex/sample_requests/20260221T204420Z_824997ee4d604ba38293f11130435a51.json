It needs to cover research, multi-format creation, cross-channel consistency, and measurable goals. \n\nLet me break down the requirements: research (foundation), multi-format (varied content types), consistency (unified messaging), and measurable goals (tracking outcomes). The education space should be implied rather than explicitly stated to save words. \n\nI can structure it as a task starting with research, then content creation across formats, followed by channel alignment, and ending with goal-setting. Keeping it under 45 words means trimming redundancy while hitting all four key elements. \n\nThe current draft flows logically from groundwork to execution to measurement, fitting the word limit. It avoids jargon while clearly outlining the campaign scope."
