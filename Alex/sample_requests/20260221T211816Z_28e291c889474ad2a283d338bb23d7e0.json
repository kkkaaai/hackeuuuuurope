          "reasoning_content": "First, the user asks for a single-sentence plain-English prompt. That means I need to create one sentence that describes the workflow.\n\nThe workflow involves: triage, automatic resolution of simple issues, escalation of complex cases, and performance tracking. All for a SaaS startup's customer support automation.\n\nThe prompt should be under 40 words. I need to count the words to ensure it's within the limit.\n\nI should output only the prompt text, nothing else.\n\nNow, let's craft the sentence. It needs to be concise and cover all elements: triage, auto-resolution, escalation, and performance tracking.\n\nPossible prompt: \"Create a customer support workflow that triages tickets, automatically resolves simple issues, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance metrics.\"\n\nLet's count the words: Create (1), a (2), customer (3), support (4), workflow (5), that (6), triages (7), tickets (8), automatically (9), resolves (10), simple (11), issues (12), escalates (13), complex (14), cases (15), and (16), tracks (17), performance (18), metrics (19). So, 19 words. Under 40, so that's fine.\n\nBut is this accurate? It covers all the points. However, I should specify it's for a SaaS startup. The user said \"for a SaaS startup,\" so I might include that.\n\nRevised prompt: \"Design a SaaS customer support automation workflow that triages issues, auto-resolves simple ones, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance.\"\n\nWord count: Design (1), a (2), SaaS (3), customer (4), support (5), automation (6), workflow (7), that (8), triages (9), issues (10), auto-resolves (11), simple (12), ones (13), escalates (14), complex (15), cases (16), and (17), tracks (18), performance (19). Still 19 words.\n\nI used \"auto-resolves\" instead of \"automatically resolves\" to save words. Also, \"ones\" refers to issues, so it's clear.\n\nTo make it more natural, I could say: \"Create an automated support workflow for a SaaS startup that triages tickets, resolves simple issues automatically, escalates complex cases, and monitors performance.\"\n\nWord count: Create (1), an (2), automated (3), support (4), workflow (5), for (6), a (7), SaaS (8), startup (9), that (10), triages (11), tickets (12), resolves (13), simple (14), issues (15), automatically (16), escalates (17), complex (18), cases (19), and (20), monitors (21), performance (22). 22 words, still under 40.\n\nThis seems good. I'll go with this version.\n\nFinally, ensure it's a single sentence and plain-English. Yes, it is.\n\nOutput only the prompt text, so I'll just write the sentence."
