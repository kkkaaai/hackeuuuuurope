          "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants a single-sentence plain-English prompt. That means I need to write one sentence that is clear and in everyday language.\n\nThe prompt should describe a high-stakes professional task in financial audits. So, I'm focusing on the field of financial audits, and the task should be important, with significant consequences.\n\nThe task requires structured analysis, identifying risks or compliance issues, proposing revisions, and delivering both technical and executive summaries. I need to incorporate all these elements into the prompt.\n\nThe output should be only the prompt text, and it must be under 45 words. I need to count the words to ensure compliance.\n\nLet me break down the requirements:\n\n- Structured analysis: This means a methodical, organized way of examining something.\n\n- Identifying risks or compliance issues: In financial audits, this could involve finding potential problems or violations of regulations.\n\n- Proposing revisions: Suggesting changes or improvements.\n\n- Delivering both technical and executive summaries: Providing detailed summaries for experts and high-level summaries for decision-makers.\n\nI need to combine these into a single sentence that describes such a task.\n\nDraft a prompt: \"Analyze a complex financial audit to identify risks and compliance gaps, propose corrective actions, and prepare detailed and executive summaries.\"\n\nNow, check the word count: \"Analyze a complex financial audit to identify risks and compliance gaps, propose corrective actions, and prepare detailed and executive summaries.\" That's 18 words. Under 45, so good.\n\nBut is it high-stakes? I mentioned \"complex financial audit,\" which implies high stakes. Maybe I can make it more explicit.\n\nRevised draft: \"Conduct a high-stakes financial audit analysis to uncover risks and compliance issues, suggest revisions, and deliver both technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nWord count: 18 words. Still under 45.\n\nEnsure it's a single sentence: Yes, it is one sentence.\n\nPlain-English: Yes, it uses simple terms.\n\nIncorporates all elements: Structured analysis is implied by \"analysis,\" risks and compliance issues are mentioned, proposing revisions is \"suggest revisions,\" and summaries are included.\n\nI think this works. Let me confirm the word count precisely.\n\n\"Conduct a high-stakes financial audit analysis to uncover risks and compliance issues, suggest revisions, and deliver both technical and executive summaries.\" – Words: Conduct, a, high-stakes, financial, audit, analysis, to, uncover, risks, and, compliance, issues, suggest, revisions, and, deliver, both, technical, and, executive, summaries. That's 21 words. Still under 45.\n\nI can make it more concise if needed, but it seems fine.\n\nFinalize the prompt."
