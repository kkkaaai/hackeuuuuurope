It includes all the steps and is under 45 words.\n\n We can also make it a bit more specific: \"From requirements to deployment, write and test Terraform code for a Kubernetes cluster, fix any bugs, and then deploy it to production.\"\n\n But let's stick with the first one or adjust.\n\n Final prompt: \"Define requirements, then build, test, fix issues, and deploy a Terraform module for a web server cluster with auto-scaling to the staging environment.\"\n\n Word count: Define (1), requirements (2), then (3), build (4), test (5), fix (6), issues (7), and (8), deploy (9), a (10), Terraform (11), module (12), for (13), a (14), web (15), server (16), cluster (17), with (18), auto-scaling (19), to (20), the (21), staging (22), environment (23). -> 23 words.\n\n This is a single sentence and under 45 words. It includes all the steps and is a realistic IaC task."
