They mentioned research, multi-format creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals. Need to keep it under 45 words and in plain English.\n\nHmm, fintech space… maybe focus on a specific topic like investing. Multi-format could include blog posts, videos, emails, and social media. Consistency across channels means maintaining the same message and branding. Measurable goals—maybe engagement and lead generation.\n\nWait, should I include all elements without being too wordy? Let me try combining: start with the research aspect, then list the formats, emphasize consistency, and end with the goals. Keep it concise. Check the word count… yeah, that should fit."
