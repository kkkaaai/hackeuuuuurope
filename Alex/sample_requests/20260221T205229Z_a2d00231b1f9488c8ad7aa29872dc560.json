          "reasoning_content": "First, I need to generate a single-sentence prompt in plain English. The prompt should describe a high-stakes professional task in financial audits. It must involve structured analysis, identifying risks or compliance issues, proposing revisions, and delivering both technical and executive summaries.\n\nKey elements from the instruction:\n- High-stakes professional task in financial audits.\n- Requires structured analysis.\n- Identifying risks or compliance issues.\n- Proposing revisions.\n- Delivering both technical and executive summaries.\n\nThe prompt should be under 45 words. I need to output only the prompt text.\n\nI'll draft a sentence that incorporates all these elements concisely. Let me try:\n\n\"Analyze audit findings to identify financial risks and compliance gaps, propose corrective revisions, and prepare both detailed technical and high-level executive summaries.\"\n\nNow, check the word count: \"Analyze audit findings to identify financial risks and compliance gaps, propose corrective revisions, and prepare both detailed technical and high-level executive summaries.\" That's 20 words. Under 45, so it's fine.\n\nBut let me ensure it captures \"high-stakes\" and \"structured analysis.\" The phrase \"analyze audit findings\" implies structured analysis. \"High-stakes\" might be implied by the context of financial risks, but I could make it more explicit. However, to keep it concise, I'll assume the task is inherently high-stakes in financial audits.\n\nAnother draft: \"Conduct a structured analysis of audit data to pinpoint risks and compliance issues, suggest revisions, and deliver technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nWord count: 18 words. Still good.\n\nI need to specify that it's for financial audits. My first draft includes \"financial risks,\" which ties it to financial audits. The second draft says \"audit data,\" which could be generic, but since the context is financial audits, it should be clear.\n\nTo be precise, I'll go with: \"Perform structured analysis on financial audit data to identify risks and compliance violations, propose revisions, and provide both technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nWord count: 22 words. That works.\n\nI think this covers all the requirements. Now, I'll output only the prompt text."
