Plain English (simple, clear language)\n3. Must include:\n   - Research component\n   - Multi-format content creation\n   - Consistency across channels\n   - Measurable goals\n4. Under 45 words\n5. Output only the prompt text (no explanation, no quotes, just the text)\n\nLet me draft options:\n\nDraft 1: Research your target audience, then create blogs, videos, and social posts that maintain consistent branding across all platforms while tracking engagement metrics to hit specific conversion goals. (24 words) - Good, covers all bases.\n\nDraft 2: Conduct market research to develop cohesive blog articles, videos, and social media content across channels with unified messaging and track click-through rates to achieve sales targets. (23 words)\n\nDraft 3: Analyze customer data to produce consistent blogs, videos, and social posts across channels then measure conversion rates to optimize the campaign. (19 words)\n\nDraft 4: Research customer pain points to create aligned blog posts, videos, and social content across platforms while measuring engagement and conversion metrics against sales goals. (19 words)\n\nDraft 5: Research target demographics, produce cohesive blogs, videos, and social posts across channels, and track engagement metrics to drive measurable revenue growth. (18 words)\n\nLet me check Draft 1:\n- Research: \"Research your target audience\" - check\n- Multi-format: \"blogs, videos, and social posts\" - check\n- Consistency across channels: \"maintain consistent branding across all platforms\" - check\n- Measurable goals: \"tracking engagement metrics to hit specific conversion goals\" - check\n- Word count: 24 words - under 45\n\nDraft 5 is tighter:\n- Research: \"Research target demographics\" - check\n- Multi-format: \"blogs, videos, and social posts\" - check  \n- Consistency: \"cohesive... across channels\" - check\n- Measurable: \"track engagement metrics to drive measurable revenue growth\" - check\n- Word count: 18 words - good\n\nDraft 6 (refining): Research customer needs, create cohesive blogs, videos, and social content across channels, and track conversion rates to hit revenue targets. (17 words)\n\nThis is clean and hits all requirements. But let me make sure \"across channels\" implies consistency - yes, \"cohesive... across channels\" covers that.\n\nActually, let me verify the exact wording requirements. The user wants a prompt describing an end-to-end content campaign task. So it should be imperative or descriptive?\n\n\"Generate a campaign that...\" or \"Create a content campaign...\" or just describing the task?\n\nThe examples above work as imperative instructions which is standard for prompts.\n\nLet me try one more that flows very naturally:\n\nResearch your audience, create cohesive blogs, videos, and social posts across channels, and measure engagement and conversions to optimize performance. (18 words)\n\nOr:\n\nResearch market trends to develop consistent blogs, videos, and social content across channels while tracking engagement metrics to achieve sales targets. (18 words)\n\nI think Draft 1 is good but maybe slightly wordy. Let me go with something clean and comprehensive:\n\nResearch customer insights to produce cohesive blogs, videos, and social posts across all channels while tracking engagement and conversion metrics to hit sales targets. (20 words)\n\nCheck criteria:\n- Single sentence? Yes\n- Plain English? Yes\n- Research? Yes (\"Research customer insights\")\n- Multi-format?
