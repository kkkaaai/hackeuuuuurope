They specified it must include research, multi-format creation, channel consistency, and measurable goals. \n\nOkay, I need to pack all those elements into one smooth sentence. Maybe start with the research aspect, then mention the content types, tie in cross-channel alignment, and end with the goal. \n\nLet me try structuring it like: \"Research and produce a multi-format educational campaign...\" That covers research and formats. Adding \"maintaining brand voice across channels\" handles consistency. Ending with \"to achieve specific engagement and conversion targets\" addresses measurability. \n\nWord count looks good too."
