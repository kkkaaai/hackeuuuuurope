The key elements are triage, auto-resolution, escalation, and tracking. \n\nI can structure it to cover the workflow flow naturally: start with triage, then handle simple issues automatically, escalate complex ones, and end with tracking. \n\nKeeping it under 40 words means using efficient phrasing like \"flagging simple issues\" and \"performance metrics\" to pack everything in. The sentence should feel complete but lean."
