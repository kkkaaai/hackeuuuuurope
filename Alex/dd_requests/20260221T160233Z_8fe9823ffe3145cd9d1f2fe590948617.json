While all part of \"extraction,\" these may require separate APIs/systems (e.g., OCR for text, tabular data parsing, metadata scraping).  \n- **Suggestion**: Break into three AEBs:  \n  1. Extract text from document  \n  2. Extract tables from document  \n  3. Extract metadata from document  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2**  \n- **Step**: Map disclosure elements to regulatory requirements using NLP-based pattern matching  \n- **Is AEB**: Yes  \n- **Reason**: Single intent (mapping), interacts with one system boundary (NLP engine), no branching/sequencing. Implemented as a single API (e.g., `map_to_regulations(input_text)`).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3**  \n- **Step**: Compare disclosure practices against industry peers and prior audits  \n- **Is AEB**: Yes  \n- **Reason**: Single intent (benchmarking), interacts with one system boundary (analytics engine). Assumes a unified API for cross-dataset comparison.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4**  \n- **Step**: Calculate quantitative materiality breaches using financial metrics  \n- **Is AEB**: Yes  \n- **Reason**: Single intent (calculation), interacts with one system boundary (calculation engine). Implemented as a single function (e.g., `calculate_materiality_risk(financial_data, thresholds)`).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5**  \n- **Step**: Cross-reference findings to prioritize gaps exceeding materiality thresholds  \n- **Is AEB**: Yes  \n- **Reason**: Single intent (prioritization), interacts with one system boundary (analysis tool). Assumes a unified API for cross-referencing datasets.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6**  \n- **Step**: Generate specific disclosure revisions aligned with best practices  \n- **Is AEB**: Yes  \n- **Reason**: Single intent (recommendation generation), interacts with one system boundary (recommendation engine). Implemented as a single API (e.g., `generate_revisions(gaps, standards)`).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7**  \n- **Step**: Synthesize findings into business impact narrative with mitigation options  \n- **Is AEB**: Yes  \n- **Reason**: Single intent (synthesis), interacts with one system boundary (narrative generation tool). Implemented as a single API (e.g., `generate_executive_summary(data)`).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 8**  \n- **Step**: Apply tracked changes to original document with rationale comments  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Combines two actions: (1) applying tracked changes and (2) adding rationale comments. These may require separate API calls (e.g., document editing + comment insertion).  \n- **Suggestion**: Break into two AEBs:  \n  1. Apply tracked changes to document  \n  2. Insert rationale comments into document  \n\n--- \n\n### Summary of Changes  \n- **Steps 1 and 8** require decomposition to meet AEB criteria.  \n- All other steps are valid AEBs as written.",
