    "aeb_analysis_raw": "### AEB Analysis Results\n\n---\n\n**Step 1**  \n- **Step:** Analyze CRM and survey data to identify customer behavior patterns  \n- **Is AEB:** No  \n- **Reason:** This step involves combining and analyzing data from two distinct sources (CRM and survey systems), which implies interacting with **multiple system boundaries**. Additionally, data analysis typically involves **sequencing** (e.g., data cleaning, transformation, modeling) and may include **branching logic** (e.g., conditional analysis).  \n- **Suggestion:** Break into:  \n  1. Retrieve CRM data from CRM system (AEB).  \n  2. Retrieve survey data from survey system (AEB).  \n  3. Analyze combined data to identify patterns (AEB, assuming a single API for analysis).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2**  \n- **Step:** Map insights to sales targets to define content themes  \n- **Is AEB:** No  \n- **Reason:** This step combines two inputs (Customer Insight Report and Sales Targets) from potentially different systems, implying **multiple system boundaries**. The \"mapping\" process may involve **branching logic** (e.g., prioritizing themes based on thresholds) or **sequencing** (e.g., iterative alignment).  \n- **Suggestion:** Break into:  \n  1. Retrieve Sales Targets from sales system (AEB).  \n  2. Map insights to targets to define themes (AEB, if implemented as a single function).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3**  \n- **Step:** Draft and produce blogs, videos, and social posts  \n- **Is AEB:** No  \n- **Reason:** This step involves **sequencing** (drafting → producing) and **multiple content types** (blogs, videos, social posts), which may require distinct workflows or tools. Producing each content type could interact with different system boundaries (e.g., CMS for blogs, social media APIs for posts).  \n- **Suggestion:** Break into:  \n  1. Draft blog content (AEB).  \n  2. Publish blog to CMS (AEB).  \n  3. Draft social media post (AEB).  \n  4. Publish social post to platforms (AEB).  \n  5. Produce video content (AEB).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4**  \n- **Step:** Schedule content publication across channels  \n- **Is AEB:** No  \n- **Reason:** Scheduling content for **multiple channels** (CMS, social media tools) implies interacting with **multiple system boundaries**. This step also involves **sequencing** (e.g., staggered schedules).  \n- **Suggestion:** Break into:  \n  1. Schedule content in CMS (AEB).  \n  2. Schedule content in social media management tool (AEB).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5**  \n- **Step:** Monitor real-time engagement metrics  \n- **Is AEB:** No  \n- **Reason:** The input is plural (\"Engagement Metrics Tracking Tools\"), indicating interaction with **multiple systems** (e.g., Google Analytics, social media APIs). Monitoring across tools cannot be a single API call.  \n- **Suggestion:** Break into:  \n  1. Monitor metrics via Tool A (AEB).  \n  2. Monitor metrics via Tool B (AEB).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6**  \n- **Step:** Track conversion events against sales targets  \n- **Is AEB:** No  \n- **Reason:** Similar to Step 5, the input (\"Conversion Metrics Tracking Tools\" plural) implies **multiple system boundaries**. Tracking conversions across tools requires separate API calls.  \n- **Suggestion:** Break into:  \n  1. Track conversions via Tool A (AEB).  \n  2. Track conversions via Tool B (AEB).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7**  \n- **Step:** Generate performance report comparing metrics to targets  \n- **Is AEB:** No  \n- **Reason:** This step aggregates data from **multiple sources** (two dashboards, sales targets), implying **multiple system boundaries**. Generating a report from disparate data may involve **sequencing** (e.g., data normalization).  \n- **Suggestion:** Break into:  \n  1. Retrieve Engagement Metrics Dashboard data (AEB).  \n  2. Retrieve Conversion Metrics Dashboard data (AEB).  \n  3. Retrieve Sales Targets (AEB).  \n  4. Generate performance report (AEB, assuming a single reporting API).  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of Key Issues  \n- **Multiple system boundaries** were the most common disqualifier (Steps 1, 2, 4–7).  \n- **Sequencing** and **branching** were issues in Steps 1, 3, and 7.  \n- **Plural inputs** (e.g., \"",
