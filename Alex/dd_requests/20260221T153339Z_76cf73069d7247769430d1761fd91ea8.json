Align protocol elements to compliance categories (AEB).  \n2. Compare aligned elements against requirements (AEB).  \n3. Generate gap matrix (AEB).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4**  \n**Step:** Calculate risk scores for gaps using severity/probability matrix  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:**  \n- Single intent: Apply a predefined risk formula (e.g., `score = severity * probability`).  \n- Interacts with one system boundary: Risk calculation API (e.g., `calculate_risk(gap_matrix, template)`).  \n- No branching/sequencing/validation: Bulk computation without conditional logic.  \n**Suggest:** N/A  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 5**  \n**Step:** Initiate parallel SME review workflows for high-risk gaps  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:**  \n- **Sequencing/Branching:** Requires iterating over high-risk gaps and initiating parallel API calls.  \n- **Multiple System Boundaries:** Involves collaboration platform API calls *per SME/thread*.  \n**Suggest:** Break into:  \n1. Filter high-risk gaps (AEB: `filter_high_risk(risk_register)`).  \n2. For each gap, initiate SME review workflow (AEB: `start_review(gap, sme_contact)`).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 6**  \n**Step:** Synthesize validated risks and SME recommendations into revision proposals  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:**  \n- Single intent: Aggregate and structure data.  \n- Interacts with one system boundary: Data synthesis API (e.g., `synthesize_recommendations(sme_responses, risk_register)`).  \n- No branching/sequencing/validation: Assumes flat data merging.  \n**Suggest:** N/A  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 7**  \n**Step:** Generate revised protocol draft with tracked changes and compliance annotations  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:**  \n- Single intent: Create a document with tracked changes.  \n- Interacts with one system boundary: Document generation API (e.g., `generate_draft(revision_plan, protocol_data)`).  \n**Suggest:** N/A  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step",
