    "aeb_analysis_raw": "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n---\n\n**Step 1**  \n- **Step**: Analyze user demographics and behavior patterns via clustering algorithms  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: The action involves **sequencing** (e.g., preprocessing data, selecting algorithms, running analysis, generating a report) and **internal logic** (choosing clustering parameters). While storing the report on a shared drive is a single system boundary, the analysis itself cannot be implemented as a single API call without breaking it into smaller steps.  \n- **Suggestion**: Split into:  \n  1. Preprocess Market Research Data → AEB (single intent, system boundary: data processing tool).  \n  2. Run clustering algorithm → AEB (single intent, system boundary: analytics API).  \n  3. Generate Audience Analysis Report → AEB (single intent, system boundary: file storage API).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2**  \n- **Step**: Map brand voice rules to audience segments to define content tone/structure  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Requires **branching** (e.g., \"if audience X, apply tone Y\") and **interpretation** of brand guidelines. This involves decision-making logic and multiple sub-steps (e.g., parsing guidelines, aligning with segments).  \n- **Suggestion**: Break into:  \n  1. Parse Brand Guidelines Document → AEB (single intent, system boundary: document API).  \n  2. Map segment X to tone Y → AEB (single intent, system boundary: rules engine).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3**  \n- **Step**: Develop blog drafts, video scripts, and social media templates  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Involves **multiple intents** (blog, video, social) and **sequencing** (e.g., drafting each content type). Each output requires distinct tools and workflows.  \n- **Suggestion**: Split into:  \n  1. Generate blog draft → AEB (single intent, system boundary: content tool API).  \n  2. Generate video script → AEB (single intent, system boundary: script tool API).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4**  \n- **Step**: Finalize and schedule content via platform-specific publishing tools  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Combines **two actions** (finalize + schedule) and interacts with **multiple system boundaries** (LinkedIn, YouTube). Scheduling across platforms requires branching (platform-specific APIs).  \n- **Suggestion**: Break into:  \n  1. Finalize content draft → AEB (single intent, system boundary: content tool API).  \n  2. Schedule on LinkedIn → AEB (single intent, system boundary: LinkedIn API).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5**  \n- **Step**: Configure tracking pixels, set up dashboard filters/metrics  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Combines **two distinct intents** (pixel configuration + dashboard setup) and interacts with **multiple system boundaries** (website codebase + analytics platform).  \n- **Suggestion**: Split into:  \n  1. Deploy tracking pixel → AEB (single intent, system boundary: website API).  \n  2. Configure dashboard metrics → AEB (single intent, system boundary: analytics tool API).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6**  \n- **Step**: Monitor engagement metrics (CTR, dwell time) over 30 days  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Involves **time-based sequencing** (wait 30 days) and **aggregation logic** (generating a report). Monitoring itself is passive, but the end-to-end process cannot be atomic.  \n- **Suggestion**: Break into:  \n  1. Collect metrics daily → AEB (single intent, system boundary: analytics API).  \n  2. Generate Campaign Performance Report → AEB (single intent, system boundary: reporting API).  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of AEB Criteria Violations  \nMost steps fail the AEB test due to **sequencing**, **branching**, or **multiple intents/system boundaries**. To comply with AEB requirements, each step must be decomposed into singular, executable actions with no internal logic or dependencies.",
