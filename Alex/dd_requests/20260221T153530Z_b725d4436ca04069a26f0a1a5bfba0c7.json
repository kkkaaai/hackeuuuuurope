Query Knowledge Base for resolution solution.  \n  2. Apply solution to ticket (e.g., auto-reply).  \n  3. Update ticket status via Ticketing System API.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4**  \n- **Step**: Select optimal engineer based on skill-match and workload  \n- **Is AEB**: Yes  \n- **Reason**: Single intent (selection), interacts with one system boundary (internal logic → Ticketing System API), no branching/sequencing.  \n- **If No**: N/A  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 5**  \n- **Step**: Update engineer workload status in tracking systems  \n- **Is AEB**: Yes  \n- **Reason**: Single intent (update workload), interacts with one system boundary (HR Management System API).  \n- **If No**: N/A  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 6**  \n- **Step**: Calculate resolution efficiency metrics and SLA adherence  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: May involve multiple calculations (sequencing) or branching logic (e.g., SLA pass/fail checks).  \n- **Suggest**: Split into:  \n  1. Calculate resolution efficiency metrics.  \n  2. Check SLA adherence against thresholds.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 7**  \n- **Step**: Generate compliance report with deviation alerts  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Contains branching (alerts require conditional logic based on thresholds).  \n- **Suggest**: Split into:  \n  1. Generate compliance report (static data).  \n  2. Trigger deviation alerts if metrics breach thresholds.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of Non-AEB Steps  \n| Step | Reason for Non-AEB | Suggested Breakdown |  \n|------|---------------------|---------------------|  \n| 3    | Workflow sequencing | 3a: Query Knowledge Base, 3b: Apply solution, 3c: Update ticket |  \n| 6    | Sequencing/branching | 6a: Calculate metrics, 6b: Check SLA adherence |  \n| 7    | Branching logic | 7a: Generate report, 7b: Trigger alerts |  \n\nAll other steps meet AEB criteria.",
