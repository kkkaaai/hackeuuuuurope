An AEB must have single intent and no internal steps.  \n- **Suggest:** Split into two AEBs:  \n  1. Ingest customer inquiry content  \n  2. Preprocess customer inquiry content  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2:**  \n- **Is AEB:** Yes  \n- **Reason:** Single intent (apply ML classification model), interacts with one system (ML model API), no branching/sequencing.  \n- **Suggest:** N/A  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3:**  \n- **Is AEB:** No  \n- **Reason:** \"Execute automated resolution workflow\" implies multiple internal steps (e.g., validation, branching logic, API calls), violating \"no sequencing.\"  \n- **Suggest:** Break into discrete actions (e.g., validate criteria, retrieve knowledge base content, execute resolution logic).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4:**  \n- **Is AEB:** Yes  \n- **Reason:** Single intent (calculate agent assignment), can be implemented as a weighted scoring function with inputs as parameters.  \n- **Suggest:** N/A  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5:**  \n- **Is AEB:** No  \n- **Reason:** \"Monitor resolution progress\" implies ongoing polling/sequencing over time, and \"calculate KPIs\" may bundle multiple metrics (resolution time vs. success rate).  \n- **Suggest:** Split into:  \n  1. Calculate resolution time KPI  \n  2. Calculate success rate KPI  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6:**  \n- **Is AEB:** No  \n- **Reason:** Combines NLP analysis (knowledge gap identification) and documentation update, which are two distinct actions with separate intents.  \n- **Suggest:** Split into:  \n  1. Apply NLP to identify knowledge gaps  \n  2. Update documentation repository with new entries  \n\n--- \n\n**Summary of Non-AEB Fixes:**  \n- Split multi-action steps (e.g., \"ingest + preprocess,\" \"workflow execution\").  \n- Separate monitoring/polling from metric calculation.  \n- Isolate NLP analysis from documentation updates.  \n- Ensure each step maps to a single API/function call with no internal logic.",
