    "aeb_analysis_raw": "### AEB Analysis Results\n\n---\n\n**Step 1**  \n- **Step**: Poll SCADA API every 5 seconds for current metrics  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: The \"every 5 seconds\" clause introduces **sequencing** (repetition over time), violating the AEB requirement of no sequencing. An AEB must be a single, atomic action, not a recurring task.  \n- **If No, suggest**: Break into two AEBs:  \n  1. **Fetch current metrics from SCADA API** (single API call).  \n  2. **Schedule recurring execution** (handled externally, not part of the AEB).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2**  \n- **Step**: Validate RPM < 1200 RPM AND vibration < 4.5 mm/s RMS  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: **Validation** (branching logic) is explicitly excluded from AEBs. The step involves conditional checks (RPM and vibration thresholds), which violate the \"no branching\" rule.  \n- **If No, suggest**: Split into two AEBs:  \n  1. **Check RPM < 1200 RPM** (single condition).  \n  2. **Check vibration < 4.5 mm/s RMS** (single condition).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3**  \n- **Step**: Run gradient ascent algorithm to maximize power output within constraints  \n- **Is AEB**: Yes  \n- **Reason**:  \n  - Single intent: Optimize turbine settings.  \n  - No branching/sequencing: Algorithm runs to completion.  \n  - One system boundary: Writes to Redis cache.  \n  - Can be implemented as a single function (e.g., `optimize_settings()`).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4**  \n- **Step**: PATCH /turbine/{id}/control endpoint with new parameters  \n- **Is AEB**: Yes  \n- **Reason**:  \n  - Single intent: Send control parameters to turbine API.  \n  - No branching/sequencing: Direct API call.  \n  - One system boundary: Interacts with turbine control system.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5**  \n- **Step**: Calculate 15-minute rolling average of power output vs. baseline  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**:  \n  - **Sequencing**: Requires historical data aggregation over time (15-minute window).  \n  - **Multiple data sources**: Uses both live sensor data and historical baseline data.  \n- **If No, suggest**: Split into two AEBs:  \n  1. **Fetch historical baseline performance data**.  \n  2. **Calculate delta metrics using live and historical data**.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6**  \n- **Step**: Compile audit log of all constraint checks and alert triggers  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Combines **report generation** (PDF creation) and **storage** (S3 upload), violating the \"single intent\" rule.  \n- **If No, suggest**: Split into two AEBs:  \n  1. **Generate PDF report from audit log**.  \n  2. **Upload PDF to S3 bucket**.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7**  \n- **Step**: Email executives with executive summary dashboard link  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Interacts with **two system boundaries** (SMTP server and Slack webhook), violating the \"one system boundary\" rule.  \n- **If No, suggest**: Split into two AEBs:  \n  1. **Send email via SMTP server**.  \n  2. **Post summary link to Slack webhook**.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Step | Is AEB? | Key Violation (If No)                | Suggested Split (If No)                          |\n|------|--------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| 1    | No     | Sequencing (polling interval)          | Fetch metrics + Schedule recurrence              |\n| 2    | No     | Validation/branching                   | Check RPM + Check vibration                      |\n| 3    | Yes    | ✅ Meets all criteria                  | N/A                                              |\n| 4    | Yes    | ✅ Meets all criteria                  | N/A                                              |\n| 5    | No     | Sequencing + multiple data sources     | Fetch baseline + Calculate delta                 |\n| 6    | No     | Multiple intents (generate + store)    | Generate PDF + Upload to S3                      |\n| 7    | No     | Two system boundaries (SMTP + Slack)   | Email executives + Post to Slack                 |",
