    "aeb_analysis_raw": "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n---\n\n**Step 1**  \n**Step:** Define inquiry routing logic based on user-provided categorization rules  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** The action involves defining logic, which typically requires branching, sequencing, and validation to ensure correctness. It is not a single executable action.  \n**Suggest:** Break into individual API calls for each routing rule (e.g., `create_routing_rule(category, destination)`).\n\n---\n\n**Step 2**  \n**Step:** Establish API connection to knowledge management system for resolution lookup  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:** Establishing a connection can be implemented as a single API call (e.g., `connect_knowledge_base(url, auth)`), assuming no branching or validation.  \n**Suggest:** N/A.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3**  \n**Step:** Implement decision trees for automated resolution pathways  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** Decision trees inherently involve branching and sequencing logic. This is not atomic.  \n**Suggest:** Break into individual decision nodes (e.g., `add_resolution_rule(condition, action)`).\n\n---\n\n**Step 4**  \n**Step:** Configure escalation thresholds and assignment rules  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:** Configuration of thresholds and rules can be done via a single API call (e.g., `set_escalation_config(thresholds, assignments)`), assuming no validation.  \n**Suggest:** N/A.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5**  \n**Step:** Connect to ticketing system API for case tracking and assignment  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:** Connecting to an API can be a single executable action (e.g., `connect_ticketing_system(api_key, endpoint)`).  \n**Suggest:** N/A.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6**  \n**Step:** Configure metrics tracking based on user-defined KPIs  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:** Configuration can be implemented as a single API call (e.g., `configure_metrics(kpis)`), assuming no validation.  \n**Suggest:** N/A.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7**  \n**Step:** Validate workflow logic consistency across all components  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** Validation inherently involves branching (e.g., checking for errors) and error handling, which violates the AEB definition.  \n**Suggest:** Remove validation entirely or break into individual checks (e.g., `validate_routing_rules()`, `validate_escalation_rules()`), but these would still require branching.\n\n---\n\n**Step 8**  \n**Step:** Deploy integrated workflow to production environment  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:** Deployment can be a single API call (e.g., `deploy_workflow(config)`), assuming the system abstracts the complexity.  \n**Suggest:** N/A.\n\n---\n\n**Step 9**  \n**Step:** Continuously monitor case resolution status from ticketing system  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** \"Continuously monitor\" implies looping or polling, which involves sequencing and potential error handling (e.g., retries).  \n**Suggest:** Break into discrete status checks (e.g., `get_case_status(case_id)`).\n\n---\n\n**Step 10**  \n**Step:** Generate performance reports by querying resolved case data  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** Generating reports involves querying data, aggregating results, and formatting outputs—sequencing and branching (e.g., handling missing data).  \n**Suggest:** Break into individual queries (e.g., `query_case_data(start_date, end_date)`, `generate_kpi_chart(kpi)`).\n\n---\n\n### Summary of AEBs  \n**Yes:** Steps 2, 4, 5, 6, 8  \n**No:** Steps 1, 3, 7, 9, 10",
