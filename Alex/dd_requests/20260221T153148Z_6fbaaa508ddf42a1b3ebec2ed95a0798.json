Extract transactional data from ERP/accounting systems.  \n  2. Validate extracted transactional data.  \n  3. Load cleaned financial dataset to Snowflake.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2**  \n- **Step**: Uses: Compliance Standards  \nAction: Retrieve and parse regulatory requirements from external APIs  \nProduces: Structured compliance framework  \nStores/Sends To: Compliance management system (e.g., ZenGRC)  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Combines **retrieval** (system boundary interaction) and **parsing** (internal processing).  \n- **Suggested Breakdown**:  \n  1. Retrieve raw regulatory requirements from external APIs.  \n  2. Parse raw regulatory requirements into structured format.  \n  3.
