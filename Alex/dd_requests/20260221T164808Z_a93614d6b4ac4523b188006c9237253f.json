Requires separate API calls for each content type.  \n- **Suggestion**: Break into:  \n  - Generate 10 blog posts  \n  - Generate 5 infographics  \n  - Generate 3 video scripts  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 5**  \n- **Step**: Conduct quality assurance check for brand consistency using text analysis tools  \n- **Is AEB**: Yes  \n- **Reason**: Single intent (QA check), single system boundary (Marketing Automation Platform).
