Contains internal sequencing.  \n**Suggestion:** Split into:  \n1. Retrieve historical customer feedback data (system: data warehouse).  \n2. Distribute surveys to target audience (system: survey tool).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2**  \n**Step:** Perform sentiment analysis and thematic clustering on feedback/survey data  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** Combines two distinct intents (sentiment analysis and clustering) and may involve separate algorithms or APIs. Contains internal sequencing.  \n**Suggestion:** Split into:  \n1. Perform sentiment analysis on feedback/survey data (system: NLP API).  \n2. Perform thematic clustering on feedback/survey data (system: clustering API).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3**  \n**Step:** Map pain points to brand-aligned content themes and draft outlines  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** Combines two sequential actions (mapping and drafting) and may involve internal branching (e.g., decision logic for alignment).  \n**Suggestion:** Split into:  \n1. Map pain points to brand-aligned content themes (system: internal logic or taxonomy API).  \n2.

Contains internal sequencing.  \n**Suggestion:** Split into:  \n1. Develop blogs, videos, and social posts (system: content creation tool).  \n2. Schedule blogs (system: CMS API).  \n3. Schedule videos (system: YouTube API).  \n4. Schedule social posts (system: LinkedIn/Twitter APIs).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 5**  \n**Step:** Configure analytics dashboards to track KPIs (e.g., CTR, form submissions)  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:** Single intent (dashboard configuration), interacts with one system boundary (analytics platform), and can be implemented as a",
