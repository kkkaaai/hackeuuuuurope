This violates the AEB requirement of having a single intent and no branching.  \n- **If No, suggest**: Break into two separate AEBs:  \n  1. **Log automated resolution**: Use Automated Response Draft, log resolution method and timestamps in analytics database.  \n  2. **Log manual resolution**: Use Escalated Case Ticket, log resolution method and timestamps in analytics database.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6**  \n- **Step**: Aggregate metrics (e.g.,",
