Synthesis may involve branching logic (e.g., prioritizing trends).  \n**Suggestion:** Split into:  \n- AEB 1: Ingest raw data from specified sources.  \n- AEB 2: Normalize data formats.  \n- AEB 3: Apply statistical analysis to identify trends.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2**  \n**Step:** Uses: [Content Strategy Document Template], [Market Analysis Report], [KPI Targets]; Action: Draft content strategy with aligned goals and messaging; Produces: Content Strategy Document  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** \"Draft content strategy\" combines **aligning goals** and **crafting messaging**, which are distinct intents. May require branching (e.g., adjusting messaging based on KPIs).  \n**Suggestion:** Split into:  \n- AEB 1: Map KPI targets to campaign goals using the Market Analysis Report.  \n- AEB 2: Populate template with aligned goals and messaging.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3**  \n**Step:** Uses: [Brand Style Guide], [Content Strategy Document]; Action: Create channel-specific content variations (blog, video, social); Produces: Draft Content Assets  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** \"Channel-specific variations\" implies branching logic (e.g., blog vs. video vs. social). Each channel requires distinct formatting and style rules.  \n**Suggestion:** Split into:  \n- AEB 1: Generate blog drafts using the style guide.  \n- AEB 2: Generate video scripts using the style guide.  \n- AEB 3: Generate social media posts using the style guide.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4**  \n**Step:** Uses: [Content Creation Tool Licenses], [Draft Content Assets]; Action: Finalize and export content in required formats (MP4, JPEG, HTML); Produces: Finalized Content Assets  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** \"Finalize and export\" involves multiple format-specific processes (e.g., video rendering vs. HTML minification), which violates **single intent** and may require sequencing.  \n**Suggestion:** Split into:  \n- AEB 1: Render video drafts to MP4 format.  \n- AEB 2: Export images to JPEG format.  \n- AEB 3: Convert web content to HTML.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5**  \n**Step:** Uses: [Campaign Calendar Template], [Finalized Content Assets]; Action: Map content to publication dates and channels; Produces: Campaign Calendar  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:** Directly maps content to dates/channels via a single API (e.g., calendar software). No branching or sequencing required if inputs are pre-validated.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6**  \n**Step:** Uses: [Analytics Integration Access], [Campaign Calendar]; Action: Deploy tracking pixels and UTM parameters across content; Produces: Instrumented Content Assets  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:** Can be implemented as a single batch API call to inject tracking parameters into content URLs. No branching or validation required.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7**  \n**Step:** Uses: [Instrumented Content Assets]; Action: Launch content across channels (social, email, web); Produces: Published Campaign  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** \"Launch across channels\" involves multiple system boundaries (e.g., social APIs, email platforms, CMS), violating **one system boundary**.  \n**Suggestion:** Split into:  \n- AEB 1: Publish content to social media platforms.  \n- AEB 2: Deploy email campaigns via email service provider.  \n- AEB 3: Upload web content to CMS.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 8**  \n**Step:** Uses: [Analytics Integration Access], [KPI Targets]; Action: Generate performance dashboard with real-time metrics; Produces: Analytics Dashboard  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:** Single API call to a BI tool (e.g., Google Data Studio/Tableau) to generate a dashboard with predefined metrics. No branching or sequencing.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 9**  \n**Step:** Uses: [Analytics Dashboard]; Action: Compile insights into executive summary report; Produces: Performance Summary Report  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** \"Compile insights\" may involve filtering/summarizing data based on stakeholder priorities (branching) and requires validation (e.g., outlier detection).  \n**Suggestion:** Split into:  \n- AEB 1: Extract KPI summaries from the dashboard.  \n- AEB 2: Generate PDF report with executive summary template.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of AEB-Compliant Steps  \n**AEBs:** Steps 5, 6,",
