    "aeb_analysis_raw": "### AEB Analysis Results\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 1**  \n**Step:** Uses Inputs 5, 6, 7 → Aggregate and analyze market trends, competitor strategies, and customer behavior → Produces Research Synthesis Report → Stores to Shared Drive  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** Combines multiple intents (aggregation + analysis of three distinct data types) and interacts with multiple system boundaries (market trends, competitor strategies, customer behavior). Produces a report, which may involve branching logic or sequencing.  \n**Suggest:** Break into:  \n1. Aggregate market trends data (AEB).  \n2. Analyze market trends → Generate Market Analysis Report (AEB).  \n3. Repeat for competitor strategies and customer behavior.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2**  \n**Step:** Uses Inputs 1, 2, 8 → Align objectives with audience insights and budget constraints → Produces Targeted Campaign Brief → Stores to Project Management Tool  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** Combines two intents (aligning with audience insights *and* budget constraints). May involve branching logic (e.g., prioritizing budget vs. audience needs).  \n**Suggest:** Split into:  \n1. Align objectives with audience insights (AEB).  \n2. Adjust objectives for budget constraints (AEB).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3**  \n**Step:** Uses Inputs 3, 4, 9 → Design multi-format content aligned with brand guidelines and channel specs → Produces Content Calendar + Asset Specifications → Stores to DAM System  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** Combines two intents (designing the calendar *and* asset specs) and two alignment requirements (brand guidelines *and* channel specs). Produces two distinct outputs.  \n**Suggest:** Split into:  \n1. Design Content Calendar aligned with brand guidelines (AEB).  \n2. Define Asset Specifications aligned with channel specs (AEB).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4**  \n**Step:** Uses Inputs 3, 4, 9 → Produce content assets and schedule cross-channel deployment → Produces Published Content Inventory → Stores to Social Media Platforms, Ad Networks, CMS  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** Combines two intents (producing assets *and* scheduling deployment) and interacts with multiple system boundaries (social media, ad networks, CMS).  \n**Suggest:** Split into:  \n1. Produce content assets (AEB).  \n2. Schedule deployment to social media platforms (AEB).  \n3. Schedule deployment to ad networks (AEB).  \n4. Schedule deployment to CMS (AEB).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 5**  \n**Step:** Uses Input 7 → Track engagement, conversions, and ROI via analytics tools → Produces Performance Dashboard → Stores to Analytics Platform  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:** Single intent (tracking metrics), interacts with one system boundary (analytics tools), no branching/sequencing. Can be implemented as a single API call (e.g., `track_campaign_metrics()`).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 6**  \n**Step:** Uses Inputs 1, 5, 6 → Adjust targeting, content mix, and spend allocation based on real-time data → Produces Optimization Recommendations → Stores to Shared Drive  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** Combines three intents (adjusting targeting, content mix, and spend). Likely requires branching logic (e.g., \"if X, then adjust Y\").  \n**Suggest:** Split into:  \n1. Adjust targeting based on real-time data (AEB).  \n2. Adjust content mix based on real-time data (AEB).  \n3. Adjust spend allocation based on real-time data (AEB).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 7**  \n**Step:** Uses Inputs 1, 5, 6 → Compile results against KPIs (ROI, audience growth) → Produces Final Campaign Report → Stores to Executive Reporting Portal  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:** Single intent (compiling results against KPIs), interacts with one system boundary (reporting portal), no branching/sequencing. Can be implemented as a single API call (e.g., `generate_final_report()`).  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of AEB Compliance  \n| Step | Is AEB? | Key Reason |  \n|------|---------|------------|  \n| 1    | No      | Multiple intents, multiple system boundaries |  \n| 2    | No      | Multiple intents |  \n| 3    | No      | Multiple intents and outputs |  \n| 4    | No      | Multiple intents and system boundaries |  \n| 5    | **Yes** | Single intent, single system boundary |  \n| 6    | No      | Multiple intents |  \n| 7    | **Yes** | Single intent, single system boundary |  \n\n**Next Steps:** Break down non-AEB steps into smaller atomic actions per the suggestions.",
