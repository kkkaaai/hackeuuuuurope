It combines multiple inputs and produces a synthesized output, violating the \"single intent\" and \"no branching/sequencing\" rules.  \n- **Suggestion:** Break into:  \n  1. **Extract pain points** from survey data (AEB).  \n  2. **Compare pain points to curriculum standards** (AEB).  \n  3. **Generate gap assessment document** (AEB).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2**  \n**Step:** Uses: Curriculum Gap Assessment Document, Brand Voice Guidelines, Target Audience Demographics  \nAction: Develop content strategy mapping gaps to audience-specific solutions with brand-aligned messaging  \nProduces: Content Strategy Blueprint  \nStores/Sends To: `/campaign/strategy/content_blueprint`  \n\n- **Is AEB:** No  \n- **Reason:** \"Develop content strategy\" requires **multi-input synthesis**, **audience segmentation**, and **brand alignment**, which involve **branching logic** (e.g., tailoring solutions to demographics) and **sequencing** (e.g., prioritizing gaps).  \n- **Suggestion:** Break into:  \n  1. **Map gaps to audience segments** (AEB).  \n  2. **Align solutions with brand voice** (AEB).  \n  3. **Generate strategy blueprint** (AEB).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3**  \n**Step:** Uses: Content Strategy Blueprint  \nAction: Write and publish 10 blog posts addressing prioritized gaps with embedded platform signup links  \nProduces: Published Blog Posts  \nStores/Sends To: CMS platform (e.g., WordPress), indexed at `https://blog.example.com/math-campaign`  \n\n- **Is AEB:** No  \n- **Reason:** \"Write and publish 10 blog posts\" involves **sequencing** (creating multiple posts) and **embedded logic** (e.g., prioritizing gaps). Writing content is inherently non-atomic if done manually, and publishing 10 posts requires repeated execution.  \n- **Suggestion:** Break into:  \n  1. **Generate draft for blog post X** (AEB).  \n  2. **Publish blog post X to CMS** (AEB).  \n  (Repeat for X = 1 to 10.)  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4**  \n**Step:** Uses: Content Strategy Blueprint  \nAction: Produce 15 video tutorials demonstrating platform features aligned with teacher needs  \nProduces: Video Tutorials  \nStores/Sends To: YouTube channel (`https://youtube.com/example`) and `/campaign/assets/video_library`  \n\n- **Is AEB:** No  \n- **Reason:** \"Produce 15 video tutorials\" involves **sequencing** (creating multiple videos) and **creative/production steps** (scripting, recording, editing).  \n- **Suggestion:** Break into:  \n  1. **Generate script for video X** (AEB).  \n  2. **Render and upload video X** (AEB).  \n  (Repeat for X = 1 to 15.)  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 5**  \n**Step:** Uses: Content Strategy Blueprint  \nAction: Schedule 30 social media posts across platforms (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn) with campaign hashtags and signup links  \nProduces: Social Media Content Calendar  \nStores/Sends To: Hootsuite dashboard and `/campaign/scheduling/social_calendar`  \n\n- **Is AEB:** No  \n- **Reason:** \"Schedule 30 social media posts\" involves **sequencing** (30 posts), **cross-platform coordination**, and **content generation** (hashtags, links).  \n- **Suggestion:** Break into:  \n  1. **Generate social media post X** (AEB).  \n  2. **Schedule post X via Hootsuite API** (AEB).  \n  (Repeat for X = 1 to 30.)  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 6**  \n**Step:** Uses: Analytics Platform Access, Platform Signup URL  \nAction: Monitor referral traffic and signup conversions from campaign assets  \nProduces: Signup Conversion Report  \nStores/Sends To: `/campaign/analytics/conversion_report.pdf`  \n\n- **Is AEB:** **Yes**  \n- **Reason:** Monitoring can be implemented as a **single API call** to an analytics platform (e.g., Google Analytics Data API) to fetch metrics, followed by **report generation** (single function). This has **single intent** (fetch + report), **one system boundary** (analytics API), and no branching/sequencing.  \n- **Suggestion:** N/A (already an AEB).  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of AEB Compliance  \n| Step | Is AEB? | Key Issue |  \n|------|---------|-----------|  \n| 1    | No      | Analysis requires branching/sequencing |  \n| 2    | No      | Strategy development involves synthesis |",
