    "aeb_analysis_raw": "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n---\n\n**Step 1**  \n- **Step**: Parse and digitize procedure steps into structured workflow  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Involves multiple actions (parsing, digitizing, diagram creation) and interacts with two system boundaries (document input and project management tool output). Contains implicit sequencing.  \n- **Suggestion**: Break into:  \n  1. Parse document → Extract raw text  \n  2. Convert text → Structured workflow format  \n  3. Generate diagram from structured workflow  \n  4. Send diagram to project management tool  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2**  \n- **Step**: Retrieve and extract relevant regulatory clauses using keyword filters  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Combines retrieval (system boundary interaction) and extraction (filtering logic). May involve implicit branching (keyword matching).  \n- **Suggestion**: Split into:  \n  1. Retrieve regulatory clauses from standards  \n  2. Extract clauses using keyword filters  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3**  \n- **Step**: Query defect recurrence rates and repair times for procedure components  \n- **Is AEB**: Yes  \n- **Reason**: Single intent (query historical data), interacts with one system boundary (database), no branching or validation. Can be implemented as a single API call.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4**  \n- **Step**: Validate procedure tolerances against manufacturer-specified limits  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: \"Validate\" implies comparison logic (branching) and error handling (e.g., pass/fail thresholds).  \n- **Suggestion**: Split into:  \n  1. Retrieve manufacturer tolerance limits  \n  2. Compare procedure tolerances with limits  \n  3. Generate compliance report  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5**  \n- **Step**: Conduct structured interview to identify undocumented risks  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Requires human interaction (interview) and involves multiple substeps (scheduling, data collection, analysis). Cannot be implemented as a single function.  \n- **Suggestion**: Split into:  \n  1. Initiate interview with SME  \n  2. Record SME responses  \n  3. Extract risks from interview data  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6**  \n- **Step**: Map procedure steps to checklist requirements using NLP matching  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Combines NLP processing (text analysis) and mapping logic. May involve sequencing (tokenization → matching → matrix generation).  \n- **Suggestion**: Split into:  \n  1. Analyze procedure steps with NLP  \n  2. Match NLP results to checklist requirements  \n  3. Generate compliance mapping matrix  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7**  \n- **Step**: Perform root-cause analysis of high-frequency defects  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Complex analytical process requiring data synthesis, statistical analysis, and hypothesis generation. Involves branching logic.  \n- **Suggestion**: Split into:  \n  1. Aggregate defect data from historical records  \n  2. Identify patterns in defect recurrence  \n  3. Generate root-cause analysis report  \n\n---\n\n**Step 8**  \n- **Step**: Score risks using regulatory thresholds and SME input  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Requires weighted scoring logic and conditional thresholds (branching).  \n- **Suggestion**: Split into:  \n  1. Retrieve regulatory thresholds  \n  2. Apply scoring algorithm to SME risks  \n  3. Generate prioritized risk register  \n\n---\n\n**Step 9**  \n- **Step**: Draft technical revisions to address gaps and risks  \n- **Is AEB**: Yes  \n- **Reason**: Single intent (drafting revisions), interacts with one system boundary (CMMS), no branching or validation. Can be implemented as a single \"generate_revisions\" function.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 10**  \n- **Step**: Generate executive summary with cost-benefit analysis of revisions  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Combines data compilation (sequencing) and cost-benefit analysis (branching logic).  \n- **Suggestion**: Split into:  \n  1. Compile cost-benefit data for revisions  \n  2. Generate executive summary report  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of AEBs  \n**Valid AEBs**: Steps 3, 9  \n**Invalid AEBs**: Steps 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 (require decomposition).",
