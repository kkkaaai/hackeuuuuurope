Retrieve live vehicle telemetry data (AEB).  \n  2. Retrieve current route parameters (AEB).  \n  3. Combine data into a deviation matrix (AEB).\n\n---\n\n**Step 2**  \n- **Step:** Uses: Safety Constraint Thresholds  \n  Action: Validate all potential route adjustments against safety boundaries  \n  Produces: Permissible Adjustment Window Specification  \n  Stores/Sends To: Constraint validation service  \n- **Is AEB:** No  \n- **Reason:**  \n  - **Validation explicitly prohibited:** The action involves validating route adjustments against safety constraints, which violates the \"no validation or error handling\" rule.  \n  - **Branching logic:** Validation inherently requires conditional checks (e.g., \"is this adjustment safe?\"), introducing branching.  \n- **Suggestion:**  \n  - Use a pre-built constraint validation API that returns a binary result (safe/unsafe) without internal branching.  \n  - Separate validation logic into a dedicated AEB (e.g., \"Check Route Adjustment Safety\" with a single API call).\n\n---\n\n**Step 3**  \n- **Step:** Uses: Historical Efficiency Metrics  \n  Action: Compute statistical baselines for route performance metrics  \n  Produces: Route Efficiency Benchmark Model  \n  Stores/Sends To: Analytics database  \n- **Is AEB:** Yes  \n- **Reason:**  \n  - **Single intent:** Computing statistical baselines (e.g., averages, percentiles) is a unified task.  \n  - **Single system boundary:** Likely interacts with a single analytics database.  \n  - **No branching/sequencing:** Assumes the computation is a single function (e.g., `compute_baselines(metrics)`).  \n- **Suggestion:** None required.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4**  \n- **Step:** Uses: Vehicle Position/Routing Deviation Matrix, Permissible Adjustment Window Specification  \n  Action: Apply optimization algorithm to create alternative routing options  \n  Produces: Candidate Route Set (3 variations)  \n  Stores/Sends To: Route evaluation module  \n- **Is AEB:** Yes  \n- **Reason:**  \n  - **Single intent:** Applying an optimization algorithm is a unified action.  \n  - **Single system boundary:** Assumes the algorithm is encapsulated in one function/API.  \n  - **No branching/sequencing:** The algorithm’s internal logic is abstracted (e.g., `generate_candidate_routes(deviation_matrix, constraints)`).  \n- **Suggestion:** None required.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5**  \n- **Step:** Uses: Candidate Route Set, Route Efficiency Benchmark Model  \n  Action: Simulate proposed routes against historical benchmarks  \n  Produces: Route Optimization Scorecard  \n  Stores",
