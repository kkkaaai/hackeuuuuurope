    "aeb_analysis_raw": "### AEB Analysis Results\n\n---\n\n**Step 1**  \n- **Step**: Normalize market size, competitor revenue, and logistics data to target region  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Combines three distinct normalization tasks (market size, competitor revenue, logistics) into one action. Even if implemented as a single function, it likely involves sequencing or branching to handle different data types.  \n- **Suggestion**: Break into three separate AEBs:  \n  - Normalize market size data  \n  - Normalize competitor revenue data  \n  - Normalize logistics data  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2**  \n- **Step**: Cluster customer segments against historical sales performance  \n- **Is AEB**: Yes  \n- **Reason**: Single intent (clustering), one system boundary (analytics database), no branching/sequencing. Can be implemented as a single clustering API/function.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3**  \n- **Step**: Calculate compliance-adjusted entry cost projections  \n- **Is AEB**: Yes  \n- **Reason**: Single intent (cost adjustment), one system boundary (financial modeling tool), no branching/sequencing. Can be implemented as a single cost-calculation API.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4**  \n- **Step**: Apply Monte Carlo simulation to model ROI volatility scenarios  \n- **Is AEB**: Yes  \n- **Reason**: Single intent (ROI modeling), one system boundary (strategy dashboard), no branching/sequencing. Monte Carlo simulations can be encapsulated in a single API.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5**  \n- **Step**: Synthesize datasets using weighted scoring algorithm  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Combines three datasets into one, which may involve sequencing (e.g., merging pairs first) or branching (e.g., conditional weighting).  \n- **Suggestion**: Break into:  \n  - Merge standardized market dataset with customer-sales correlation matrix  \n  - Merge intermediate result with adjusted cost model  \n  - Apply weighted scoring algorithm to final merged dataset  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6**  \n- **Step**: Generate prioritized strategy recommendations via decision-tree analysis  \n- **Is AEB**: Yes  \n- **Reason**: Single intent (recommendation generation), one system boundary (strategy dashboard), no branching/sequencing. Decision-tree models can be implemented as a single API.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7**  \n- **Step**: Conduct gap analysis between entry requirements and market realities  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Involves comparing multiple inputs (regulatory, infrastructure, competitor data), which likely requires sequencing/branching to evaluate gaps across domains.  \n- **Suggestion**: Break into:  \n  - Compare regulatory requirements vs. infrastructure metrics  \n  - Compare regulatory requirements vs. competitor financials  \n  - Aggregate results into a risk assessment report  \n\n--- \n\n### Summary of AEB Compliance  \n- **AEBs**: Steps 2, 3, 4, 6  \n- **Non-AEBs**: Steps 1, 5, 7 (require breakdown)",
