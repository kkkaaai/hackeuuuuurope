Stores/Sends To: Risk analysis module  \n- **Is AEB:** No  \n- **Reason:** Combines two distinct inputs (weighted risk factors and regulatory priorities) with implicit logic for weighting and prioritization. This may involve branching (e.g., conditional prioritization rules) or sequencing (e.g., first weighting, then combining).  \n- **Suggest:** Break into two AEBs:  \n  1. Apply weights to SME Risk Criteria.  \n  2. Merge weighted SME criteria with regulatory priorities.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4**  \n- **Step:** Uses: Compliance Check Framework (Input 6), Structured Protocol Metadata.
