Call Vehicle Telemetry API → Store raw telemetry  \n2. Call Traffic Data API → Store raw traffic  \n3. Call Weather Data API → Store raw weather  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2**  \n**Step:** Uses: Historical Fleet Performance Database  \nAction: Query database for 30-day average performance metrics  \nProduces: Historical performance dataset  \nStores/Sends To: Analytics engine  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:**  \n- **Single intent**: Query a single database.  \n- **One system boundary**: Database.  \n- **No branching/sequencing/validation**: Pure read operation.  \n- **Implementable as a single API/function**: E.g., `get_30_day_avg_metrics()`.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3**  \n**Step:** Uses: Safe Operational Limits, API Access Credentials  \nAction: Load and verify user-defined limits against system configuration  \nProduces: Validated constraint framework  \nStores/Sends To: Optimization engine  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:**  \n- **Validation included**: \"Verify\" implies error handling/branching logic (e.g., pass/fail checks).  \n- **Dual intent**: Load **and** verify (two distinct actions).  \n**If No, suggest:**  \nSplit into two AEBs:  \n1. Load user-defined limits → Output raw limits  \n2. Validate limits against config → Output pass/fail + sanitized limits  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4**  \n**Step:** Uses: Unified live data stream, Historical performance dataset  \nAction: Run ML model to predict route efficiency and risk factors  \nProduces: Predicted delay hotspots, fuel burn forecasts  \nStores/Sends To: Optimization engine  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:**  \n- **Single intent**: Run ML model.  \n- **One system boundary**: ML model API (even if internally complex, it can be abstracted as a single function).  \n- **No branching/sequencing/validation**: Assumes model execution is deterministic.  \n- **Implementable as a single API/function**: E.g., `run_ml_prediction_model(data)`.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5**  \n**Step:** Uses: Predicted delay hotspots, fuel burn forecasts, Validated constraint framework  \nAction: Calculate optimal speed/route adjustments within safety boundaries  \nProduces: Adjusted route parameters  \nStores/Sends To: Fleet management system API  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:**  \n- **Single intent**: Optimization calculation.  \n- **One system boundary**: Optimization engine.  \n- **No branching/sequencing/validation**: Assumes pure computation (no conditional logic).  \n- **Implementable as a single API/function**: E.g., `calculate_optimal_route(params)`.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6**  \n**Step:** Uses: Adjusted route parameters, Vehicle Telemetry Data  \nAction: Track actual vs. predicted performance metrics  \nProduces: Adjustment effectiveness metrics  \nStores/Sends To: Analytics dashboard  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:**  \n- **Single intent**: Compare actual vs. predicted.  \n- **One system boundary**: Analytics dashboard (or internal tracking system).  \n- **No branching/sequencing/validation**: Assumes simple metric calculation.  \n- **Implementable as a single API/function**: E.g., `track_performance(actual, predicted)`.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7**  \n**Step:** Uses: Adjustment effectiveness metrics, Performance Metrics Targets  \nAction: Calculate variance from targets and regulatory compliance status  \nProduces: Performance gain report  \nStores/Sends To: Management portal (PDF + API endpoint)  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:**  \n- **Branching logic**: \"Regulatory compliance status\" implies conditional checks (e.g., compliant/non-compliant).  \n- **Multiple outputs/system boundaries**: PDF **and** API endpoint.  \n**If No, suggest:**  \nSplit into three AEBs:  \n1. Calculate variance from targets → Output variance metrics  \n2. Check regulatory compliance → Output compliance status  \n3. Generate PDF report → Store in Management portal  \n4. Send metrics to API endpoint → Store in Management portal  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of AEB Compliance  \n| Step | Is AEB? | Key Issue (If No) |  \n|------|---------|-------------------|  \n| 1    | No      | Multiple APIs, aggregation sequencing |  \n| 2    | Yes     | - |  \n| 3    | No      | Validation, dual intent |  \n| 4    | Yes     | - |  \n| 5    | Yes     | - |  \n|",
