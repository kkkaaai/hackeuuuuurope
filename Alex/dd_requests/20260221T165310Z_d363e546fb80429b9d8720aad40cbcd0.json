This violates the \"single intent\" and \"single output\" requirements.  \n**Suggestion:** Break into two AEBs:  \n1. Analyze market trends → Market Trend Analysis Report  \n2. Analyze audience segmentation → Audience Segmentation Matrix  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2**  \n**Step:** Uses: Brand Guidelines, Market Trend Analysis Report  \nAction: Develop core messaging framework aligned with brand identity and market insights  \nProduces: Core Messaging Document  \nStores/Sends To: Shared drive, content creation platform  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:** Single intent (developing a messaging framework), single output (Core Messaging Document), and no branching/sequencing. It interacts with one system boundary (internal tools).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3**  \n**Step:** Uses: Audience Segmentation Matrix, Content Calendar  \nAction: Map content themes to channels and timelines using audience-persona alignment  \nProduces: Channel-Specific Content Briefs  \nStores/Sends To: CMS, creative team workspaces  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:** Single intent (mapping themes to channels/timelines), single output (Content Briefs), and no branching/sequencing.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4**  \n**Step:** Uses: Target KPIs, Channel-Specific Content Briefs  \nAction: Configure KPI tracking parameters for each channel (e.g., UTM codes, conversion events)  \nProduces: KPI Configuration File  \nStores/Sends To: Analytics tools (Google Analytics, Meta Ads Manager)  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:** Single intent (configuring tracking parameters), single output (KPI Configuration File), and interacts with one system boundary (analytics tools).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 5**  \n**Step:** Uses: Core Messaging Document, Channel-Specific Content Briefs  \nAction: Generate and quality-check content assets for each channel  \nProduces: Finalized Content Assets  \nStores/Sends To: CMS, cloud storage  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** Combines **two distinct actions** (generation and quality-checking) with implicit sequencing (generate first, then QC). Violates \"no branching/sequencing\" and \"single intent\" rules.  \n**Suggestion:** Break into two AEBs:  \n1. Generate content assets → Draft Content Assets  \n2. Quality-check content → Finalized Content Assets  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 6**  \n**Step:** Uses: KPI Configuration File, Finalized Content Assets  \nAction: Deploy content and tracking infrastructure across channels  \nProduces: Published Campaign Content, Active Tracking Endpoints  \nStores/Sends To: Social platforms, email servers, analytics dashboards  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** Combines **two distinct intents** (deploying content and deploying tracking infrastructure) and produces two outputs. Violates \"single intent\" and \"single output\" rules.  \n**Suggestion:** Break into two AEBs:  \n1. Deploy content assets → Published Campaign Content  \n2. Deploy tracking infrastructure → Active Tracking Endpoints  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 7**  \n**Step:** Uses: Active Tracking Endpoints, Target KPIs  \nAction: Aggregate performance data and compare against targets  \nProduces: Campaign Execution Report  \nStores/Sends To: Cloud storage, stakeholder portal  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:** Single intent (performance evaluation), single output (Campaign Execution Report), and no branching/sequencing.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of AEB Compliance  \n| Step | Is AEB? | Key Issue (If Not) |  \n|------|---------|--------------------|  \n| 1    | No      | Multiple intents/outputs |  \n| 2    | Yes     | -                  |  \n| 3    | Yes     | -                  |  \n| 4    | Yes     | -                  |  \n| 5    | No      | Generation + QC    |  \n| 6    | No      | Content + tracking deployment |  \n| 7    | Yes     | -                  |  \n\n**Final Note:** Steps 1, 5, and 6 require decomposition to meet AEB requirements. All other steps are valid AEBs.",
