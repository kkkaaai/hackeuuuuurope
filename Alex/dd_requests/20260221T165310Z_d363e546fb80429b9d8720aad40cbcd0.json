    "aeb_analysis_raw": "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n---\n\n**Step 1:**  \n- **Step:** Synthesize fintech market trends and competitive gaps  \n- **Is AEB:** No  \n- **Reason:** Synthesizing involves multiple sub-tasks (e.g., analyzing trends, identifying gaps) and combines two data sources, introducing sequencing and potential branching.  \n- **Suggestion:** Break into:  \n  1. Analyze Market Research Data → Market Trends Summary  \n  2. Compare Trends with Competitor Dataset → Competitive Gaps Report  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2:**  \n- **Step:** Cluster CRM data using market trends to build personas  \n- **Is AEB:** No  \n- **Reason:** Clustering requires preprocessing data, applying algorithms, and validating results, which implies internal sequencing and decision-making.  \n- **Suggestion:** Split into:  \n  1. Preprocess CRM Data with Market Trends → Structured Dataset  \n  2. Apply Clustering Algorithm → Raw Personas  \n  3. Validate Personas → Finalized User Personas  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3:**  \n- **Step:** Develop core messaging framework with persona-specific variants  \n- **Is AEB:** No  \n- **Reason:** Creating a framework and variants requires branching logic (e.g., conditional rules for personas) and multiple implementation steps.  \n- **Suggestion:** Split into:  \n  1. Generate Core Messaging Framework → Core Framework  \n  2. Apply Persona Rules to Core Framework → Variant 1, Variant 2, etc.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4:**  \n- **Step:** Create channel-optimized content assets (e.g., ad copy, visuals)  \n- **Is AEB:** No  \n- **Reason:** \"Channel-optimized\" implies distinct processes for each channel (e.g., social media vs. email), requiring branching.  \n- **Suggestion:** Split into:  \n  1. Generate Social Media Assets → Social Content  \n  2. Generate Email Assets → Email Content  \n  3. Generate Ad Assets → Paid Ad Creatives  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5:**  \n- **Step:** Map content assets to channels with budget constraints  \n- **Is AEB:** No  \n- **Reason:** Budget allocation involves optimization logic (branching/sequencing) and may require iterative adjustments.  \n- **Suggestion:** Split into:  \n  1. Calculate Budget Allocation per Channel → Budget Plan  \n  2. Assign Assets to Channels → Distribution Schedule  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6:**  \n- **Step:** Configure tracking tags and reporting intervals  \n- **Is AEB:** No  \n- **Reason:** Combines two distinct actions (tagging and scheduling) with separate system interactions.  \n- **Suggestion:** Split into:  \n  1. Deploy Tracking Tags → Active Tags  \n  2. Set Reporting Intervals → Schedule Configuration  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7:**  \n- **Step:** Audit content against regulatory requirements  \n- **Is AEB:** Yes  \n- **Reason:** Compliance checks can often be implemented as a single API call (input: content + rules; output: audit report) with no branching.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 8:**  \n- **Step:** Launch campaign and activate monitoring  \n- **Is AEB:** No  \n- **Reason:** Combines two intents (launching and activating monitoring), violating single-intent rule.  \n- **Suggestion:** Split into:  \n  1. Deploy Campaign Assets → Live Campaign Instance  \n  2. Enable Monitoring Tools → Active Monitoring  \n\n---\n\n**Step 9:**  \n- **Step:** Generate weekly KPI summaries for stakeholders  \n- **Is AEB:** Yes  \n- **Reason:** Reporting can be a single API call (input: KPI data; output: summary) with no sequencing or branching.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of AEBs  \n**Valid AEBs:** Steps 7, 9  \n**Invalid AEBs:** Steps 1–6, 8 (require decomposition).",
