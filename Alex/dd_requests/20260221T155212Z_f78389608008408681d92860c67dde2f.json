    "aeb_analysis_raw": "### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n---\n\n**Step 1**  \n- **Step**: Analyze course content and audience segmentation to develop 3-5 campaign themes  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Involves analysis (multiple sub-steps: data processing, segmentation, theme generation) and combines intent (analysis + theme creation). Requires branching/sequencing for theme selection.  \n- **Suggestion**: Break into:  \n  1. Analyze course content and audience data (AEB: single API for data analysis).  \n  2. Generate campaign themes from insights (AEB: theme-generation API).  \n  3. Save Campaign Themes document to shared drive (AEB: file upload API).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2**  \n- **Step**: Create content calendar with staggered release schedule across channels  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Combines scheduling logic (sequencing) and cross-channel coordination (multiple system boundaries). Requires branching for channel-specific rules.  \n- **Suggestion**: Break into:  \n  1. Schedule email content releases (AEB: email tool API).  \n  2. Schedule blog/social content releases (AEB: CMS/social API).  \n  3. Compile calendar into a spreadsheet (AEB: spreadsheet API).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3**  \n- **Step**: Design and produce visual assets for each campaign theme  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Combines multiple asset types (video, graphics, headers) with different tools. Requires sequencing for design steps.  \n- **Suggestion**: Break into:  \n  1. Generate video files for a theme (AEB: video API).  \n  2. Create blog graphics (AEB: design tool API).  \n  3. Produce email headers (AEB: image generation API).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4**  \n- **Step**: Develop email templates and blog post drafts following brand guidelines  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Combines two distinct outputs (email + blog) and enforces brand rules (implicit validation).  \n- **Suggestion**: Break into:  \n  1. Generate email templates (AEB: email template API).  \n  2. Create blog post drafts (AEB: CMS API).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5**  \n- **Step**: Schedule content delivery across email, blog, and social platforms  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Interacts with multiple system boundaries (email, blog, social). Requires sequencing for staggered releases.  \n- **Suggestion**: Break into:  \n  1. Schedule email content (AEB: email automation API).  \n  2. Schedule blog posts (AEB: CMS API).  \n  3. Schedule social media posts (AEB: social media API).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6**  \n- **Step**: Implement tracking parameters (UTM codes, pixel tags) in all content  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Requires modifying multiple content types (branching logic) and validation to ensure tracking is applied.  \n- **Suggestion**: Break into:  \n  1. Append UTM codes to URLs in email/blog content (AEB: URL modification API).  \n  2. Add pixel tags to visual assets (AEB: image editing API).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7**  \n- **Step**: Generate weekly performance reports comparing against baseline metrics  \n- **Is AEB**: Yes  \n- **Reason**: Single intent (report generation), interacts with one system (analytics platform), no branching/sequencing. Can be implemented as a single API call (e.g., `generate_report()`).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 8**  \n- **Step**: Conduct biweekly optimization sessions to adjust content strategy  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Requires human judgment (non-executable action), involves analysis and decision-making (branching logic).  \n- **Suggestion**: Break into:  \n  1. Fetch engagement data for review (AEB: analytics API).  \n  2. Generate strategy recommendations (AEB: AI recommendation API).  \n  3. Save recommendations to documentation (AEB: document update API).  \n\n--- \n\n### Summary of Key Patterns:  \n- **Multi-output steps** (e.g., designing multiple asset types) need splitting.  \n- **Cross-channel actions** (e.g., scheduling to email/blog/social) require separation.  \n- **Human-driven processes** (e.g., optimization sessions) must be decomposed into machine-executable subtasks.  \n- **Validation/branching logic** (e.g., applying tracking to diverse content) disqualifies AEB status.",
