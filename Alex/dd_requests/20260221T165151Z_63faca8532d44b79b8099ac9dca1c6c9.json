    "aeb_analysis_raw": "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n---\n\n**Step 1**  \n- **Step:** Analyze technical requirements and compliance constraints  \n- **Is AEB:** No  \n- **Reason:** This step involves cognitive analysis, which inherently includes branching logic (e.g., \"if this requirement applies, then do X\"), validation (e.g., checking compliance), and interpretation. It is not a directly executable action but rather a decision-making process.  \n- **Suggestion:** Break into atomic actions like:  \n  - \"Extract PCI-DSS compliance rules from the Payment Method Specification Document\"  \n  - \"Validate extracted rules against PCI-DSS Compliance Standards\"  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2**  \n- **Step:** Code integration of payment functionality with environment-specific parameters  \n- **Is AEB:** No  \n- **Reason:** While the output is a modified codebase, the action involves multiple subtasks (e.g., importing SDKs, modifying code files, applying configuration). It lacks single intent and may include branching (e.g., conditional logic for environment parameters).  \n- **Suggestion:** Break into:  \n  - \"Integrate Payment Provider SDK into Mobile App Source Code\"  \n  - \"Apply Staging Environment Configuration Parameters to Payment Integration\"  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3**  \n- **Step:** Run automated test suite against payment provider sandbox environment  \n- **Is AEB:** Yes  \n- **Reason:** This is a single intent (execute tests), interacts with one system boundary (sandbox environment), and can be implemented as a single API call (e.g., `run_test_suite(environment=\"sandbox\")`). It contains no branching or validation logic in the action itself.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4**  \n- **Step:** Analyze logs and fix identified issues  \n- **Is AEB:** No  \n- **Reason:** This involves analysis (branching logic like \"if error type A, do X\") and error handling (fixing issues), which violate AEB constraints.  \n- **Suggestion:** Break into:  \n  - \"Retrieve logs from staging environment\"  \n  - \"Generate debug artifacts from logs\"  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5**  \n- **Step:** Execute deployment pipeline to staging environment  \n- **Is AEB:** Yes  \n- **Reason:** If the deployment pipeline is triggered via a single API call (e.g., `deploy_to_staging()`), it meets AEB criteria: single intent, one system boundary (staging environment), and no internal sequencing/branching. The pipeline’s internal complexity is abstracted away.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Step | Is AEB? | Reason | Suggestion (if No) |\n|------|--------|--------|--------------------|\n| 1 | No | Cognitive analysis with branching/validation | Break into rule extraction and validation |\n| 2 | No | Multiple subtasks and branching | Split into SDK integration and config application |\n| 3 | Yes | Directly executable with single intent | N/A |\n| 4 | No | Involves analysis and error handling | Split into log retrieval and artifact generation |\n| 5 | Yes | Single API call to trigger pipeline | N/A |",
