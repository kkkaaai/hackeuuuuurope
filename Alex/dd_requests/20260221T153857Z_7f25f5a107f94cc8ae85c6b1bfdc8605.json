    "aeb_analysis_raw": "### AEB Analysis for Each Step\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 1**  \n- **Step:** Validate sensor data against safety thresholds to identify constraint violations  \n- **Is AEB:** No  \n- **Reason:** This step involves **validation**, which is explicitly prohibited in AEBs. Validation inherently includes **branching logic** (e.g., \"if data exceeds threshold, log violation\").  \n- **Suggestion:** Break into two steps:  \n  1. **Read sensor data** (AEB: Yes – single intent, no branching).  \n  2. **Check data against safety thresholds** (AEB: No – still involves validation; further break into a separate AEB for logging violations if thresholds are exceeded).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2**  \n- **Step:** Calculate current efficiency metrics (MPG, deliveries/hour) vs historical averages  \n- **Is AEB:** Yes  \n- **Reason:** This is a **single intent** (calculate metrics), involves **no branching or sequencing**, and can be implemented as a single function/API call. It interacts with one system boundary (Analytics database).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3**  \n- **Step:** Generate optimization model with safety constraints and efficiency targets  \n- **Is AEB:** Yes  \n- **Reason:** The action has a **single intent** (generate a model), uses two inputs, and produces a single output. If implemented as a single API call to an optimization engine, it qualifies as an AEB.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4**  \n- **Step:** Run real-time optimization algorithm to calculate parameter adjustments  \n- **Is AEB:** Yes  \n- **Reason:** This is a **directly executable action** (run an algorithm), has **single intent**, and interacts with one system boundary (Fleet management system). It can be implemented as a single function call.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 5**  \n- **Step:** Deploy parameter updates to vehicle ECUs through secure API connection  \n- **Is AEB:** Yes  \n- **Reason:** This is a **single API call** to deploy updates, with **no branching or sequencing**. It interacts with one system boundary (Vehicle systems).  \n\n---\n\n#### **",
