This introduces sequencing, branching, and multi-system interaction.  \n**Suggestion:** Break into separate AEBs:  \n1. Analyze market research trends (single intent, one system boundary).  \n2. Identify competitor gaps (single intent, one system boundary).  \n3. Extract audience preferences (single intent, one system boundary).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2**  \n**Step:** Uses Brand Guidelines Document (1), Campaign Channels Selected (4), Content Formats Required (10); Action: Map brand voice to channel-specific formats; Produces: Content Strategy Blueprint  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** Mapping brand voice to multiple channels implies branching logic (e.g., \"if channel X, apply format Y\"). Each channel-format mapping is a distinct intent and system boundary.  \n**Suggestion:** Split into per-channel mappings:  \n1. Map brand voice to Channel A format.  \n2. Map brand voice to Channel B format.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3**  \n**Step:** Uses Content Strategy Blueprint (Output of Step 2), Content Variations (11); Action: Develop and review content drafts for all channels; Produces: Finalized Content Assets  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** Combines \"develop\" and \"review\" actions (sequencing) and spans multiple channels (system boundaries).  \n**Suggestion:** Split into:  \n1. Develop content drafts for Channel A.  \n2. Review content drafts for Channel A.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4**  \n**Step:** Uses Campaign Schedule (8), Distribution Parameters (9), Finalized Content Assets (Output of Step 3); Action: Schedule posts, configure ad parameters, and launch campaign; Produces: Campaign Deployment Confirmation  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** Combines three distinct actions (scheduling, configuring, launching) with different system boundaries (e.g., ad platforms, campaign tools).  \n**Suggestion:** Split into:  \n1. Schedule posts via Campaign Management API.  \n2. Configure ad parameters in Ad Platform API.  \n3. Launch campaign via Campaign Execution API.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 5**  \n**Step:** Uses Engagement Metrics (13), Conversion Metrics (14); Action: Aggregate metrics into dashboards; Produces: Performance Reports (12)  \n**Is AEB:** **Yes**  \n**Reason:** Single intent (aggregation), single system boundary (e.g., Google Data Studio API), no branching/sequencing. Implementable as a single API call (e.g., `POST /dashboard.aggregate`).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 6**  \n**Step:** Uses Performance Reports (12), Engagement Targets (2), Conversion Targets (3); Action: Compare results to targets and identify gaps; Produces: Optimization Recommendations Document  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** Involves branching logic (e.g., \"if metric < target, flag gap\") and dual comparisons (engagement + conversion).  \n**Suggestion:** Split into:  \n1. Compare engagement metrics to targets.  \n2. Compare conversion metrics to targets.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 7**  \n**Step:** Uses Optimization Recommendations Document (Output of Step 6); Action: Refine content, retarget ads, or adjust schedule; Produces: Updated Content Assets & Distribution Parameters  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** Combines three distinct actions (refine, retarget, adjust) with different system boundaries (DAM, ad platforms, scheduling tools).  \n**Suggestion:** Split into:  \n1. Refine content via DAM API.  \n2. Retarget ads via Ad Platform API.  \n3. Adjust schedule via Campaign Management API.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary  \n- **AEBs:** Step 5  \n- **Non-AEBs:** Steps 1–4, 6–7 (require decomposition into single-intent, single",
