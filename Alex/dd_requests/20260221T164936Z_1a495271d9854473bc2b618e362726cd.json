It combines multiple tasks (comparison, documentation) that cannot be implemented as a single function.  \n**Suggestion:** Break into:  \n1. Compare stakeholder needs vs. design constraints (AEB).  \n2. Document discrepancies as a Requirements Specification Document (AEB).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2**  \n**Step:** Uses: Design Mockup, Existing App Style Guide  \nAction: Build reusable UI elements (e.g., profile cards, edit forms) adhering to style guide  \nProduces: UI Component Library  \nStores/Sends To: Version control system (e.g., Git)  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** The action includes **multiple intents** (building profile cards, edit forms, etc.) and **sequencing** (e.g., building components in a specific order). A single function cannot encapsulate all these tasks.  \n**Suggestion:** Break into individual AEBs:  \n1. Build profile card UI component (single function).  \n2. Build edit form UI component (single function).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3**  \n**Step:** Uses: User Data API Endpoint, Authentication Token  \nAction: Implement API calls to fetch/update user data with token-based authentication  \nProduces: Integrated Frontend-Backend Profile Module  \nStores/Sends To: Development environment  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** The action includes **multiple intents** (\"fetch\" and \"update\") and may involve **branching** (e.g., handling token expiration). Each API call should be a separate AEB.  \n**Suggestion:** Split into:  \n1. Implement fetch user data API call (single function).  \n2. Implement update user data API call (single function).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4**  \n**Step:** Uses: Test Cases, Integrated Frontend-Backend Profile Module  \nAction: Run automated/manual tests against scenarios; log defects  \nProduces: Test Execution Report with Bug Log  \nStores/Sends To: QA dashboard  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** Combines **automated** and **manual** testing (branching) and involves **sequencing** (running multiple test scenarios). These cannot be implemented as a single function.  \n**Suggestion:** Split into:  \n1. Execute automated test suite (single function).  \n2. Execute manual test scenarios (single function).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 5**  \n**Step:** Uses: Test Execution Report with Bug Log  \nAction: Debug and resolve defects in UI or API integration  \nProduces: Fixed Profile Page Build Artifact  \nStores/Sends To: Staging environment  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** The action involves **branching** (e.g., \"if defect is UI, fix UI; if API, fix API\") and **sequencing** (debugging multiple defects).  \n**Suggestion:** Split into:  \n1. Fix UI defect: [specific defect] (single function).  \n2. Fix API defect: [specific defect] (single function).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 6**  \n**Step:** Uses: Fixed Profile Page Build Artifact, Deployment Configuration  \nAction: Trigger CI/CD pipeline to deploy artifact using environment-specific settings  \nProduces: Production Deployment Confirmation  \nStores/Sends To: Production server  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:** Triggering a CI/CD pipeline is a single intent, interacts with one system boundary (CI/CD tool), and can be implemented as a single API call (e.g., `POST /pipeline-trigger`).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 7**  \n**Step:** Uses: Production Deployment Confirmation  \nAction: Verify functionality in production via smoke tests  \nProduces: Deployment Logs  \nStores/Sends To: Monitoring system  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:** Smoke testing can be implemented as a single function (e.g., `run_smoke_tests()`), interacts with one system boundary (production environment), and has no branching or sequencing.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of AEBs  \n- **Valid AEBs:** Steps 6 and 7.  \n- **Invalid AEBs:** Steps 1–5 (require decomposition).",
