    "aeb_analysis_raw": "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 1**  \n**Step:** Perform discrepancy analysis to map audit findings to specific procedural gaps  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:**  \n- **Branching/Logic Required**: Mapping audit findings to procedural gaps inherently involves conditional logic (e.g., \"if finding X exists, then gap Y is identified\").  \n- **Multiple Substeps**: Requires parsing audit data, identifying gaps, and generating a matrix.  \n- **System Boundary Interaction**: Involves reading from and writing to systems (FAA Audit Report, Compliance Management System).  \n**Suggestion:** Break into:  \n1. Retrieve audit findings (AEB).  \n2. Compare findings to procedures (AEB).  \n3. Generate gap mapping matrix (AEB).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2**  \n**Step:** Benchmark current procedures against regulatory requirements and recommended practices  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:**  \n- **Analysis Complexity**: Benchmarking requires comparing procedures to multiple standards (FAA, Industry Best Practices), which involves branching logic (e.g., \"if procedure A meets standard B, then mark as compliant\").  \n- **Multiple Inputs**: Combines three data sources (Existing Procedures, FAA Standards, Best Practices).  \n**Suggestion:** Break into:  \n1. Retrieve FAA Compliance Standards (AEB).  \n2. Retrieve Industry Best Practices (AEB).  \n3. Compare procedures to standards (AEB).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3**  \n**Step:** Develop prioritized revision proposals incorporating cost-benefit analysis  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:**  \n- **Sequencing/Logic**: Prioritization and cost-benefit analysis require ranking proposals (sequencing) and decision logic (e.g., \"if cost < benefit, prioritize\").  \n- **Multiple Inputs**: Combines gap matrix, cost data, and regulatory reports.  \n**Suggestion:** Break into:  \n1. Retrieve gap mapping matrix (AEB).  \n2. Calculate cost-benefit ratios (AEB).  \n3. Rank proposals by priority (AEB).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4**  \n**Step:** Generate cost estimates for proposed procedural changes using regression analysis  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:**  \n- **Single Intent**: Regression analysis on historical data is a single mathematical operation.  \n- **System Boundary**: Reads from Historical Maintenance Cost Data and writes to a spreadsheet.  \n- **No Branching/Sequencing**: Regression is a deterministic calculation.  \n**Note:** Assumes regression analysis is implemented as a single API/function.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 5**  \n**Step:** Finalize compliance plan with executive decision points and risk assessments  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:**  \n- **Branching/Validation**: Incorporating decision points and risk assessments requires conditional logic (e.g., \"if risk > threshold, add mitigation\").  \n- **Multiple Inputs**: Combines draft plan, cost data, and executive feedback.  \n**Suggestion:** Break into:  \n1. Retrieve Draft Compliance Plan (AEB).  \n2. Add executive decision points (AEB).  \n3. Append risk assessments (AEB).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 6**  \n**Step:** Compile technical summary with engineering details and implementation specifications  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:**  \n- **Single Intent**: Compiling a summary is a document-generation task.  \n- **System Boundary**: Reads from Audit Analysis Report and Revised Compliance Plan, writes to a repository.  \n- **No Logic**: Assumes the summary is a structured aggregation of inputs.  \n**Note:** Valid only if no analysis or synthesis is required (e.g., copy-paste of existing data).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 7**  \n**Step:** Create executive summary emphasizing strategic priorities and ROI metrics  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:**  \n- **Analysis Complexity**: Requires selecting strategic priorities and calculating ROI metrics, which involves branching logic (e.g., \"if ROI > 10%, highlight\").  \n- **Multiple Inputs**: Combines compliance plan, cost data, and regulatory reports.  \n**Suggestion:** Break into:  \n1. Extract ROI metrics (AEB).  \n2. Align with strategic priorities (AEB).  \n3. Generate executive summary (AEB).  \n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Step | Is AEB | Key Reason for Non-AEB |\n|------|------|-------------------------|\n| 1    | No   | Branching logic, multiple substeps |\n| 2    | No   | Benchmarking logic, multiple inputs |\n| 3    | No   | Prioritization sequencing, cost-benefit logic |\n| 4    | Yes  | Single regression function |\n| 5    | No   | Decision points, risk logic |\n| 6    | Yes  | Document generation |\n| 7    | No   | ROI prioritization logic, multiple inputs |",
