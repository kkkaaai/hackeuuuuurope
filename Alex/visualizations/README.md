# Task Decomposition Visualizations

This folder contains interactive HTML visualizations of task decomposition hierarchies.

## Quick Start

**Open `index.html` in your web browser** to see a dashboard with all task visualizations.

Or click any of the individual `_graph.html` files to view a specific task hierarchy.

## What You'll See

### Index Page (`index.html`)
A beautiful dashboard showing:
- Grid of all task visualizations
- Color legend (green = simple, red = complex, grey = below threshold)
- Statistics
- Direct links to each graph

### Individual Graphs (`*_graph.html`)
Interactive visualizations of each task hierarchy showing:
- **Root task** at the top
- **Subtasks** arranged horizontally below
- **Color coding** based on complexity (green → orange → red)
- **Connected lines** showing task relationships
- **Hover tooltips** with full task details

## How to Use

### Navigation
- **Zoom**: Scroll wheel or trackpad pinch
- **Pan**: Click and drag
- **Reset**: Double-click anywhere
- **Hover**: See task ID, complexity score, and full description

### Color Legend
| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 🟢 Green | Low Complexity (30-40) |
| 🟠 Orange | Medium Complexity (50-70) |
| 🔴 Red | High Complexity (80+) |
| ⚫ Dark Grey | Below Threshold or Unknown |
