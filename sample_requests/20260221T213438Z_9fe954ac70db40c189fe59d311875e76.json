The key elements mentioned are research, multi-format creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals. The prompt needs to be under 45 words.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure all required components are included. Research is foundational, so starting with that makes sense. Multi-format creation could include blogs, videos, social posts—got to highlight variety. Consistency across channels means maintaining a unified voice and message. Measurable goals tie it all to outcomes like engagement or conversions.\n\nKeeping it concise is crucial. Avoiding jargon to stay plain-English. Maybe structure it as a directive: \"Design and execute a campaign that...\" Wait, that's too vague. Specify the education space—maybe \"for an online course.\" Add the formats explicitly: blog series, video tutorials, social posts. End with the goal: increase sign-ups. Check word count... Yes, under 45. Does it flow smoothly as one sentence? Yep."
