          "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants a single-sentence plain-English prompt. That means I need to write one sentence that is clear and in everyday language.\n\nThe prompt should describe a multi-case customer support automation workflow for a telecom operator. The workflow involves:\n\n1. Triage – sorting or prioritizing issues.\n\n2. Automatic resolution of simple issues – fixing easy problems automatically.\n\n3. Escalation of complex cases – sending harder issues to human agents.\n\n4. Performance tracking – monitoring how well the workflow is doing.\n\nI need to output only the prompt text, and it must be under 40 words. So, I have to keep it concise.\n\nLet me brainstorm a sentence that covers all these elements:\n\n- Start with the overall goal: automation workflow for customer support.\n\n- Include triage: maybe \"sort incoming queries\"\n\n- Automatic resolution: \"resolve common issues automatically\"\n\n- Escalation: \"escalate complex cases to agents\"\n\n- Performance tracking: \"track performance metrics\"\n\nNow, combine these into a single sentence. Ensure it's plain English, so avoid jargon.\n\nPossible sentence: \"Create an automated system that triages customer queries, resolves simple issues automatically, escalates complex cases to human agents, and tracks performance metrics for a telecom operator.\"\n\nCount the words: \"Create an automated system that triages customer queries, resolves simple issues automatically, escalates complex cases to human agents, and tracks performance metrics for a telecom operator.\" – Let's count: Create (1), an (2), automated (3), system (4), that (5), triages (6), customer (7), queries (8), resolves (9), simple (10), issues (11), automatically (12), escalates (13), complex (14), cases (15), to (16), human (17), agents (18), and (19), tracks (20), performance (21), metrics (22), for (23), a (24), telecom (25), operator (26). That's 26 words, under 40. Good.\n\nBut is it a prompt? The user says \"prompt,\" so it should be something that instructs or describes what to do. This sentence is instructing to create such a system, so it works.\n\nMake sure it's single-sentence. Yes, it is.\n\nPlain-English: Yes, it uses simple terms.\n\nUnder 40 words: 26 words, so okay.\n\nI can make it even more concise if needed, but this seems fine.\n\nFinal check: The prompt should describe the workflow, so this sentence does that.\n\nOutput only the prompt text: So, I'll just write the sentence without any additional explanation."
