Let me break down the requirements: it needs to cover triage, auto-resolution, escalation, and performance tracking. \n\nOkay, \"customer queries\" can cover all incoming issues. \"Automatically categorize\" handles triage. \"Resolve common problems\" takes care of simple fixes. \"Route complex cases to agents\" deals with escalation. \"Track all outcomes\" satisfies the performance tracking part. \n\nThat's 19 words – well under the limit. The sentence flows logically from intake to resolution tracking, which should meet the user's needs without extra fluff."
