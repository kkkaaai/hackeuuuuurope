          "reasoning_content": "First, the prompt must be a single sentence in plain English. It should describe a realistic end-to-end operational workflow in the fintech domain. The workflow needs to coordinate multiple tools, resolve at least one constraint, update systems, and deliver a final outcome.\n\nKey elements:\n- Fintech domain: Think about financial technology, like banking, payments, lending, investments, etc.\n- End-to-end operational workflow: This means a complete process from start to finish.\n- Coordinate multiple tools: This implies using different software or systems.\n- Resolve at least one constraint: Something like a limit, a rule, or a problem that needs to be overcome.\n- Update systems: After resolving the constraint, systems need to be updated.\n- Deliver a final outcome: There should be a clear result or output.\n\nThe prompt should be under 40 words. I need to output only the prompt text.\n\nI need to craft a concise sentence that incorporates all these elements. Let me brainstorm some fintech workflows:\n\n1. Loan approval process: Check credit score, assess risk, approve or deny, update loan system.\n2. Payment processing: Verify funds, handle fraud checks, process transaction, update accounts.\n3. Investment trading: Execute trade, comply with regulations, update portfolio, confirm trade.\n\nNow, ensure it includes multiple tools, constraint resolution, system updates, and final outcome.\n\nExample: \"Process a customer's loan application by checking credit via multiple APIs, resolving a debt-to-income ratio constraint, updating the loan management system, and issuing an approval decision.\"\n\nLet's check the word count: \"Process a customer's loan application by checking credit via multiple APIs, resolving a debt-to-income ratio constraint, updating the loan management system, and issuing an approval decision.\" That's 24 words. Good.\n\nBut is it realistic? Yes, in fintech, loan applications often involve credit checks, risk assessment, and system updates.\n\nAnother example: \"Execute a stock trade after verifying funds, bypassing a daily limit exception, updating the trading platform, and confirming settlement.\" Word count: 16 words. This includes multiple tools (trading platform, verification systems), resolving a constraint (daily limit exception), updating systems (trading platform), and delivering an outcome (confirming settlement).\n\nI think both are fine, but I'll choose one.\n\nI need to make sure it's end-to-end and operational. The first example might be better because it explicitly mentions multiple APIs, which are tools.\n\nRefine the prompt: \"Coordinate a loan approval by integrating credit and income verification tools, overriding a risk threshold after manual review, updating the CRM, and disbursing funds.\" Word count: 20 words.\n\nThat covers multiple tools (credit and income verification tools), resolving a constraint (overriding a risk threshold), updating systems (CRM), and delivering an outcome (disbursing funds).\n\nBut \"overriding a risk threshold\" might not be the best constraint resolution; it could be \"resolving a collateral shortfall\" or something.\n\nTo keep it simple, I'll go with the first one I thought of.\n\nFinal prompt: \"Process a customer's loan application by checking credit via multiple APIs, resolving a debt-to-income ratio constraint, updating the loan management system, and issuing an approval decision.\"\n\nWord count: 24 words. Under 40 words. It's a single sentence. Plain English. Fintech domain. End-to-end workflow. Coordinates multiple tools (APIs), resolves a constraint (debt-to-income ratio), updates systems (loan management system), and delivers an outcome (approval decision).\n\nI think this works."
