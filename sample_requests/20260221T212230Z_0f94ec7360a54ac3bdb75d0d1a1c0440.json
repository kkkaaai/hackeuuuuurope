Let me break down their requirements.\n\nFirst, the prompt needs to be in plain English, under 45 words. It should involve research and analysis, specifically in climate adaptation. The task must include gathering multiple sources, synthesizing insights, handling uncertainty, and producing a structured deliverable.\n\nHmm, climate adaptation is broad. Maybe focus on a concrete output like a policy brief or risk assessment. Need to ensure all elements are covered: multi-source data, synthesis, uncertainty, and a structured format. \n\nHow about starting with the action verb \"Synthesize\"? That covers both gathering and merging insights. Mentioning \"diverse sources\" addresses the multi-source requirement. Including \"uncertainties in climate projections\" tackles handling uncertainty. Ending with a \"policy brief\" provides the structured deliverable. \n\nLet me check the word count. \"Synthesize diverse climate data and expert analyses to create a coastal adaptation policy brief that explicitly addresses uncertainties in sea-level rise projections.\" That’s 20 words. All requirements seem met. Yeah, this should work."
