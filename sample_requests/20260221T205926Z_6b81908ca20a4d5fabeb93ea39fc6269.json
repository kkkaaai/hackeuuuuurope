          "reasoning_content": "First, the task is to generate a single-sentence prompt in plain English. It should describe a complex research and analysis task in climate adaptation. The task must involve gathering information from multiple sources, synthesizing insights, handling uncertainty, and producing a structured deliverable. Also, the prompt should be under 45 words.\n\nKey elements:\n- Complex research and analysis task in climate adaptation.\n- Gathering information from multiple sources.\n- Synthesizing insights.\n- Handling uncertainty.\n- Producing a structured deliverable.\n- Single sentence, plain English.\n- Under 45 words.\n\nI need to condense all these into one concise sentence. Let me brainstorm some ideas.\n\nPossible structure: \"Research and analyze climate adaptation strategies by gathering data from various sources, synthesizing findings, addressing uncertainties, and producing a structured report.\"\n\nThat covers the elements, but let's make it more specific to climate adaptation. Also, ensure it's under 45 words. Count the words in the example: \"Research and analyze climate adaptation strategies by gathering data from various sources, synthesizing findings, addressing uncertainties, and producing a structured report.\" That's 20 words. Good.\n\nBut is it complex? I should imply complexity by mentioning multiple sources and uncertainty. Perhaps add \"complex\" explicitly. For example: \"Conduct a complex analysis of climate adaptation options by integrating diverse data sources, synthesizing insights, managing uncertainties, and delivering a structured assessment.\"\n\nWord count: \"Conduct a complex analysis of climate adaptation options by integrating diverse data sources, synthesizing insights, managing uncertainties, and delivering a structured assessment.\" That's 18 words.\n\nAnother version: \"Gather information from multiple sources to research climate adaptation, synthesize insights while handling uncertainty, and produce a structured deliverable.\" That's 19 words, but it's a bit flat. I can make it more engaging.\n\nTo ensure it's a prompt, it should be directive. Like: \"Perform a comprehensive climate adaptation analysis that requires collecting data from various sources, synthesizing insights, accounting for uncertainties, and creating a structured report.\"\n\nWord count: \"Perform a comprehensive climate adaptation analysis that requires collecting data from various sources, synthesizing insights, accounting for uncertainties, and creating a structured report.\" That's 21 words.\n\nI need to check if all elements are included: complex research (implied by \"comprehensive\"), gathering from multiple sources (\"various sources\"), synthesizing insights, handling uncertainty (\"accounting for uncertainties\"), and structured deliverable (\"structured report\").\n\nYes, that works. But let's refine to make it more precise. The prompt should be clear and direct.\n\nFinal attempt: \"Assess climate adaptation strategies by compiling data from diverse sources, synthesizing key insights, addressing uncertainties, and producing a structured analysis document.\"\n\nWord count: 16 words. Good.\n\nI'll go with this. But let's confirm it's under 45 words. Yes, 16 words.\n\nOutput only the prompt text, so I'll write it without any additional explanation."
