          "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants me to generate a single-sentence prompt. It must be in plain English and describe an end-to-end content campaign task in the healthcare space. The task should involve research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals.\n\nKey elements:\n- End-to-end content campaign task\n- Healthcare space\n- Involves: research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, measurable goals\n- Output only the prompt text\n- Under 45 words\n\nI need to craft a concise sentence that includes all these aspects. Let me brainstorm a bit.\n\nPossible structure: \"Create a healthcare content campaign that includes research, produces multiple content formats, ensures consistency across channels, and sets measurable goals.\"\n\nBut that's a bit straightforward. I should make it more like a task prompt. Since it's a prompt, it should be instructional.\n\nThe user says \"prompt describing an end-to-end content campaign task,\" so it might be something like: \"Develop an end-to-end healthcare content campaign involving research, multi-format creation, channel consistency, and measurable outcomes.\"\n\nI need to ensure it's under 45 words. Let me count the words in my attempts.\n\nAttempt 1: \"Create a healthcare content campaign that includes research, produces multiple content formats, ensures consistency across channels, and sets measurable goals.\" Words: 14. That's under 45, but is it end-to-end? I mentioned \"campaign,\" which implies end-to-end, but I should explicitly say \"end-to-end.\"\n\nRevised: \"Develop an end-to-end healthcare content campaign that involves research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals.\" Words: 14. Still under 45.\n\nBut to make it more natural: \"Plan and execute a healthcare content campaign from research to multi-format creation, ensuring consistency across channels with measurable goals.\" Words: 16.\n\nI think that covers all elements. Let me list them:\n- Research: included\n- Multi-format content creation: \"multi-format creation\"\n- Consistency across channels: \"ensuring consistency across channels\"\n- Measurable goals: \"with measurable goals\"\n- End-to-end: \"Plan and execute... from research to...\"\n\nYes, that seems good.\n\nNow, ensure it's a single sentence. My examples are all single sentences.\n\nFinal check: under 45 words. My last attempt is 16 words, so it's fine.\n\nI'll go with: \"Plan and execute an end-to-end healthcare content campaign involving research, multi-format creation, consistent messaging across channels, and measurable goals.\"\n\nWords: 15. Perfect."
