          "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants a single-sentence plain-English prompt. That means it should be one sentence, in simple English, without jargon or complex structures.\n\nThe prompt should describe a multi-case customer support automation workflow for a telecom operator. The workflow includes:\n- Triage\n- Automatic resolution of simple issues\n- Escalation of complex cases\n- Performance tracking\n\nI need to condense this into a single sentence under 40 words. So, I have to be concise and cover all these elements.\n\nLet me list the key components:\n1. Triage: Sorting or categorizing customer issues.\n2. Automatic resolution: Handling simple issues automatically.\n3. Escalation: Sending complex cases to human agents.\n4. Performance tracking: Monitoring how well the system works.\n\nNow, I need to phrase this as a prompt. The prompt is for describing the workflow, so it should instruct someone to create or explain this workflow. But the user says \"Generate one single-sentence plain-English prompt describing...\" so the output should be the prompt text itself.\n\nThe user says: \"output only the prompt text under 40 words.\" So, I need to write the prompt that describes the workflow, and it must be under 40 words.\n\nI should write a prompt that might be used to guide an AI or a team to design this workflow. For example: \"Describe a customer support automation workflow for a telecom operator that triages issues, automatically resolves simple ones, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance.\"\n\nBut I need to ensure it's a single sentence and under 40 words. Let me count the words in that example: \"Describe a customer support automation workflow for a telecom operator that triages issues, automatically resolves simple ones, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance.\" That's 20 words. Good.\n\nIs it clear? Yes, it covers all the elements: triage, automatic resolution, escalation, and performance tracking. It specifies \"for a telecom operator\" and \"customer support automation workflow.\"\n\nI should make sure it's plain-English, so avoid technical terms. This seems straightforward.\n\nNow, check the word count: \"Describe a customer support automation workflow for a telecom operator that triages issues, automatically resolves simple ones, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance.\" Let's list the words:\n\n1. Describe\n2. a\n3. customer\n4. support\n5. automation\n6. workflow\n7. for\n8. a\n9. telecom\n10. operator\n11. that\n12. triages\n13. issues\n14. automatically\n15. resolves\n16. simple\n17. ones\n18. escalates\n19. complex\n20. cases\n21. and\n22. tracks\n23. performance.\n\nThat's 23 words. Under 40, so it's fine.\n\nIs it a single sentence? Yes, it starts with \"Describe\" and has one main clause.\n\nI could make it more concise, but this seems good. Alternatively, I might rephrase to sound more natural. For example: \"Create a prompt for an automated telecom support system that sorts queries, fixes easy problems automatically, sends hard ones to agents, and monitors efficiency.\"\n\nBut that might not include \"performance tracking\" explicitly. \"Monitors efficiency\" is similar, but \"performance tracking\" is more specific. The original list includes \"performance tracking,\" so I should keep that.\n\nIn my first attempt, I used \"tracks performance,\" which is fine.\n\nTo ensure it's under 40 words, I'll stick with the first version.\n\nFinal output should be only the prompt text, so no additional explanations.\n\nThus, my response is: \"Describe a customer support automation workflow for a telecom operator that triages issues, automatically resolves simple ones, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance.\""
