          "reasoning_content": "First, the prompt must be a single sentence in plain English. It should describe a realistic end-to-end operational workflow in e-commerce. The workflow needs to coordinate multiple tools, resolve at least one constraint, update systems, and deliver a final outcome.\n\nKey elements:\n- E-commerce domain: This involves online shopping, orders, inventory, payments, shipping, etc.\n- End-to-end operational workflow: A complete process from start to finish, like from order placement to delivery.\n- Coordinate multiple tools: This could include software systems like CRM, inventory management, payment gateways, shipping APIs, etc.\n- Resolve at least one constraint: Examples include stock shortages, payment failures, shipping delays, or customer preferences.\n- Update systems: After resolving constraints, systems like inventory or order status need to be updated.\n- Deliver a final outcome: Such as a confirmed order, shipped product, or customer notification.\n\nI need to output only the prompt text and keep it under 40 words. So, I must craft a concise sentence that incorporates all these elements.\n\nLet me brainstorm a realistic scenario: A customer places an order, but the item is out of stock. The system needs to check alternative warehouses, update inventory, process payment, and notify the customer upon shipment.\n\nNow, condense this into a single sentence under 40 words.\n\nDraft: \"When a customer orders an out-of-stock item, the system must locate it in another warehouse, update inventory and order status, process payment, and arrange shipment to fulfill the order.\"\n\nCount words: \"When a customer orders an out-of-stock item, the system must locate it in another warehouse, update inventory and order status, process payment, and arrange shipment to fulfill the order.\" That's 24 words. Good, but let's ensure it includes coordinating multiple tools and resolving a constraint.\n\nThe constraint is the out-of-stock item, which is resolved by locating it in another warehouse. Multiple tools: inventory system, payment processor, shipping service. Systems updated: inventory and order status. Final outcome: order fulfilled.\n\nThis seems to cover all aspects. But I can make it more precise.\n\nAnother draft: \"Handle a backordered item by coordinating inventory checks, payment processing, and shipping logistics to update systems and deliver the product to the customer.\"\n\nWord count: 18 words. But does it specify resolving a constraint? \"Backordered item\" implies a constraint, but it's not explicitly stated as resolving it. Also, \"coordinating inventory checks\" might not clearly indicate multiple tools.\n\nLet's refine: \"Resolve an inventory shortage by sourcing from alternate suppliers, updating order and inventory systems, and coordinating payment and shipping to complete the customer's purchase.\"\n\nWord count: 21 words. This includes resolving a constraint (inventory shortage), updating systems (order and inventory), coordinating multiple tools (sourcing, payment, shipping), and delivering a final outcome (complete the purchase).\n\nI think this works. But let's ensure it's end-to-end operational workflow in e-commerce.\n\nFinal prompt: \"Manage an order with a payment failure by verifying funds, updating the transaction status, and coordinating inventory and shipping to finally deliver the purchased items.\"\n\nWord count: 22 words. This also fits.\n\nI need to choose one that best meets all criteria. The instruction says \"output only the prompt text,\" so I'll write one final version.\n\nI'll go with: \"When a customer's payment fails, the system must verify alternative payment methods, update order and inventory systems, and coordinate shipping to successfully deliver the purchased goods.\"\n\nWord count: 22 words. Yes, this includes coordinating multiple tools (payment verification, inventory systems, shipping), resolving a constraint (payment failure), updating systems (order and inventory), and delivering a final outcome (successful delivery).\n\nThis is realistic in e-commerce. Now, ensure it's under 40 words: 22 words is fine.\n\nI'll output this."
