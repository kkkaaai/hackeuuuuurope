          "reasoning_content": "First, the user asks for a single-sentence plain-English prompt. That means I need to create a clear, straightforward sentence in everyday language.\n\nThe prompt should describe a realistic end-to-end operational workflow in the fintech domain. Fintech involves financial technology, so examples could include banking, payments, lending, investments, etc.\n\nThe workflow must involve coordinating multiple tools. So, I need to mention different tools or systems that work together.\n\nIt should also resolve at least one constraint. Constraints could be things like regulatory limits, risk thresholds, time constraints, or resource limitations.\n\nThe workflow needs to update systems, meaning some databases or software are modified during the process.\n\nFinally, it must deliver a final outcome. This could be a completed transaction, a report, a decision, etc.\n\nThe output should only be the prompt text, and it must be under 40 words. I need to count the words to ensure compliance.\n\nLet me brainstorm a fintech workflow. For example:\n\n- Loan approval process: Coordinating credit scoring tools, fraud detection systems, and customer databases. Resolving a credit limit constraint. Updating the loan management system. Delivering a loan decision.\n\n- Payment processing: Coordinating payment gateways, anti-money laundering checks, and ledger systems. Resolving a transaction limit constraint. Updating account balances. Delivering payment confirmation.\n\n- Investment portfolio rebalancing: Coordinating trading platforms, risk assessment tools, and portfolio management systems. Resolving a diversification constraint. Updating portfolio holdings. Delivering rebalanced portfolio.\n\nI need to fit all these elements into one sentence. Let's try to draft one.\n\nExample: \"Process a customer's loan application by checking credit scores and fraud alerts, resolving a debt-to-income ratio limit, updating the loan system, and issuing an approval or denial.\"\n\nCount words: \"Process a customer's loan application by checking credit scores and fraud alerts, resolving a debt-to-income ratio limit, updating the loan system, and issuing an approval or denial.\" That's 24 words. It includes coordinating tools (credit scores and fraud alerts), resolving a constraint (debt-to-income ratio limit), updating systems (loan system), and delivering an outcome (approval or denial). This seems realistic in fintech.\n\nBut is it end-to-end? It covers from application to decision, so yes.\n\nI need to ensure it's under 40 words. My draft is 24 words, so that's fine.\n\nI should make it more specific to fintech. Fintech often involves digital platforms, so perhaps mention digital tools.\n\nAnother example: \"Automate a stock trade by analyzing market data and risk models, overcoming a price volatility constraint, updating the trading ledger, and executing the order.\"\n\nWords: \"Automate a stock trade by analyzing market data and risk models, overcoming a price volatility constraint, updating the trading ledger, and executing the order.\" That's 20 words. Good.\n\nBut does it coordinate multiple tools? Yes, market data and risk models. Constraint: price volatility. Updating: trading ledger. Outcome: executing the order.\n\nI think both are acceptable, but I'll choose one.\n\nSince the user said \"generate one,\" I need to output only one prompt.\n\nI'll go with the first one about loan application as it's very typical in fintech.\n\nFinal prompt: \"Process a customer's loan application by checking credit scores and fraud alerts, resolving a debt-to-income ratio limit, updating the loan system, and issuing an approval or denial.\"\n\nTo make it even more concise, I can tweak it.\n\n\"Coordinate credit checks and fraud detection to process a loan application, resolve a debt-to-income constraint, update the loan management system, and deliver a decision.\"\n\nWords: \"Coordinate credit checks and fraud detection to process a loan application, resolve a debt-to-income constraint, update the loan management system, and deliver a decision.\" That's 22 words.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nI'll output this as the prompt text."
