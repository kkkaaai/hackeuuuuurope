Let me break down the requirements: it needs to be a single sentence under 45 words, in plain English, and cover research, multi-format content creation, cross-channel consistency, and measurable goals.  \n\nOkay, the healthcare space is broad, so I’ll keep it general but actionable. Research first, then content types like blogs and social media, followed by channel alignment and goal-setting. Maybe start with \"Develop and execute...\" to imply end-to-end ownership.  \n\nWait, 45 words is tight. Let me draft: \"Develop and execute a patient-focused content campaign involving research, creating blog posts and social media, ensuring message consistency, and tracking engagement metrics.\" That hits all four points—research, multi-format, consistency, measurable goals—and fits the word limit."
