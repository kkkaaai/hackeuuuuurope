          "reasoning_content": "First, I need to generate a single-sentence prompt in plain English. The prompt should describe an end-to-end content campaign task in the education space. It must include specific elements: research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals.\n\nKey requirements:\n- Single sentence: So I can't use multiple sentences; it has to be one cohesive sentence.\n- Plain English: Avoid jargon, keep it simple and understandable.\n- End-to-end content campaign task: This implies a complete process from start to finish.\n- Education space: The context is education, so topics related to learning, teaching, schools, etc.\n- Involves: research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals.\n- Output only the prompt text: I shouldn't add any extra explanation or formatting.\n- Under 45 words: I need to count the words to ensure it's less than 45.\n\nI need to craft a sentence that incorporates all these elements concisely. Let me brainstorm some ideas:\n\n- Start with the action: \"Create an end-to-end content campaign for education that involves...\"\n- Ensure it includes research: \"based on research\" or \"starting with research\"\n- Multi-format content creation: \"producing content in multiple formats\" like blogs, videos, infographics, etc.\n- Consistency across channels: \"ensuring consistency across all marketing channels\"\n- Measurable goals: \"with measurable goals to track success\"\n\nNow, combine these into one sentence. I'll try to make it flow naturally.\n\nExample: \"Develop a comprehensive education content campaign that begins with research, creates multi-format content, maintains consistency across channels, and sets measurable goals for success.\"\n\nLet's count the words: Develop (1), a (2), comprehensive (3), education (4), content (5), campaign (6), that (7), begins (8), with (9), research (10), creates (11), multi-format (12), content (13), maintains (14), consistency (15), across (16), channels (17), and (18), sets (19), measurable (20), goals (21), for (22), success (23). That's 23 words, which is under 45. But is it end-to-end? \"Begins with research\" implies a start, but \"end-to-end\" should cover the entire process. Maybe I can tweak it.\n\nAnother version: \"Plan and execute an education content campaign from research to multi-format content creation, ensuring consistency across channels and defining measurable goals.\"\n\nWord count: Plan (1), and (2), execute (3), an (4), education (5), content (6), campaign (7), from (8), research (9), to (10), multi-format (11), content (12), creation (13), ensuring (14), consistency (15), across (16), channels (17), and (18), defining (19), measurable (20), goals (21). That's 21 words.\n\nI need to include \"end-to-end\" explicitly? The prompt says \"describing an end-to-end content campaign task,\" so the sentence should convey that without necessarily using the term \"end-to-end.\" But to be clear, I can include it.\n\nRevised: \"Design an end-to-end content campaign for the education sector involving research, multi-format content creation, cross-channel consistency, and measurable outcomes.\"\n\nWord count: Design (1), an (2), end-to-end (3), content (4), campaign (5), for (6), the (7), education (8), sector (9), involving (10), research (11), multi-format (12), content (13), creation (14), cross-channel (15), consistency (16), and (17), measurable (18), outcomes (19). That's 19 words.\n\nThis covers all elements: research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels (cross-channel consistency), and measurable goals (outcomes). It's in the education sector. And it's a single sentence.\n\nI think this works. Let me ensure it's under 45 words: yes, 19 words.\n\nFinal check: Is it plain English? Yes, straightforward language. Does it describe the task? Yes. Is it single sentence? Yes.\n\nSo, I'll go with this: \"Design an end-to-end content campaign for the education sector involving research, multi-format content creation, cross-channel consistency, and measurable outcomes.\"\n\nBut to make it more task-oriented, I can use \"Create\" instead of \"Design\". Also, \"measurable goals\" might be better than \"measurable outcomes\" to match the requirement.\n\nAdjusted: \"Create an end-to-end content campaign for education that involves research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals.\"\n\nWord count: Create (1), an (2), end-to-end (3), content (4), campaign (5), for (6), education (7), that (8), involves (9), research (10), multi-format (11), content (12), creation (13), consistency (14), across (15), channels (16), and (17), measurable (18), goals (19). 19 words.\n\nThis is clear and meets all criteria."
