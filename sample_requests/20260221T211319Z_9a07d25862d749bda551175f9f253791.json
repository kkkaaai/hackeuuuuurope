          "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants a single-sentence prompt in plain English. It should describe a realistic software engineering task in backend microservices. The task must include defining requirements, building components, testing, fixing issues, and deploying to an environment.\n\nKey elements to cover:\n- Defining requirements\n- Building components\n- Testing\n- Fixing issues\n- Deploying to an environment\n\nI need to ensure it's under 45 words and output only the prompt text.\n\nLet me brainstorm a concise sentence. I'll start by listing the actions:\n1. Define requirements for a new feature.\n2. Build the necessary microservices components.\n3. Test the implementation.\n4. Fix any issues found.\n5. Deploy to a staging or production environment.\n\nNow, combine these into one sentence. For example: \"Create a user authentication microservice by defining its API specs, implementing the code, running unit and integration tests, debugging failures, and deploying it to the staging environment.\"\n\nCount the words: \"Create a user authentication microservice by defining its API specs, implementing the code, running unit and integration tests, debugging failures, and deploying it to the staging environment.\" That's 22 words. Good.\n\nIs it realistic? Yes, user authentication is common in microservices. Does it include all elements? Let's check:\n- Defining requirements: \"defining its API specs\" covers requirements.\n- Building components: \"implementing the code\" covers building.\n- Testing: \"running unit and integration tests\" covers testing.\n- Fixing issues: \"debugging failures\" covers fixing issues.\n- Deploying: \"deploying it to the staging environment\" covers deploying.\n\nIt's a single sentence and under 45 words. I think this works.\n\nTo make it more specific, I could mention backend microservices explicitly, but it's already implied. The prompt says \"backend microservices,\" so the example should reflect that. User authentication microservice is a backend component.\n\nAnother option: \"Develop a payment processing microservice from requirements gathering through coding, testing, bug fixing, to deployment in a cloud environment.\" That's 18 words. But \"requirements gathering\" might be broader than defining requirements. Also, \"bug fixing\" covers fixing issues.\n\nI'll stick with the first one or refine it slightly.\n\nFinal prompt: \"Build a backend microservice for order tracking by specifying requirements, coding components, testing thoroughly, resolving defects, and deploying to production.\"\n\nWord count: 16 words. Checks all boxes.\n\nBut let's ensure it's single-sentence and plain English. Yes.\n\nI'll go with: \"Create a user authentication microservice by defining API requirements, developing the code, executing tests, fixing bugs, and deploying to a staging environment.\"\n\nThat's 20 words. Perfect."
