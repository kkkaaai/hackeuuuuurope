They asked for a single-sentence prompt under 45 words that includes research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals in education.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure all the required elements are covered. The user mentioned \"end-to-end content campaign task,\" so the prompt should start with an action-oriented phrase. \"Design a content campaign\" fits well and keeps it concise.\n\nNext, the education space is specified. Adding \"for a new high school financial literacy course\" narrows it down and gives context. Now, the key components: research, multi-format creation, consistency, and measurable goals. \n\nI can combine \"research-backed\" to cover the research aspect. \"Multi-format content\" addresses the creation part. \"Aligned across social media, email, and a webinar\" ensures consistency across channels. Finally, \"with clear enrollment conversion metrics\" ties in measurable goals. \n\nChecking the word count: \"Design a research-backed, multi-format content campaign for a new high school financial literacy course, aligned across social media, email, and a webinar, with clear enrollment conversion metrics.\" That's 30 words, under the limit. It flows as one sentence and hits all the points."
