          "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants a single-sentence plain-English prompt. That means it should be one sentence, in simple English, no jargon or complex terms.\n\nThe prompt should describe a multi-case customer support automation workflow for a SaaS startup. The workflow involves:\n\n- Triage: Sorting or categorizing customer issues.\n\n- Automatic resolution of simple issues: Handling easy problems automatically.\n\n- Escalation of complex cases: Sending difficult issues to human agents or higher support levels.\n\n- Performance tracking: Monitoring and measuring how well the workflow is performing.\n\nI need to output only the prompt text, and it must be under 40 words. So, I should count the words to ensure it's within the limit.\n\nLet me draft a sentence that covers all these elements concisely.\n\nDraft 1: \"Create a customer support workflow that triages tickets, automatically resolves simple issues, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance metrics.\"\n\nNow, count the words: Create (1), a (2), customer (3), support (4), workflow (5), that (6), triages (7), tickets (8), automatically (9), resolves (10), simple (11), issues (12), escalates (13), complex (14), cases (15), and (16), tracks (17), performance (18), metrics (19). So, 19 words. Under 40, good.\n\nBut is this clear and plain English? Yes, it seems straightforward. However, I should specify it's for a SaaS startup. The user mentioned \"for a SaaS startup,\" so I need to include that context.\n\nRevised draft: \"Design a SaaS customer support workflow that triages issues, auto-resolves simple ones, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance.\"\n\nWord count: Design (1), a (2), SaaS (3), customer (4), support (5), workflow (6), that (7), triages (8), issues (9), auto-resolves (10), simple (11), ones (12), escalates (13), complex (14), cases (15), and (16), tracks (17), performance (18). 18 words.\n\nI used \"auto-resolves\" to save words, but it's still plain English. Alternatively, I could use \"automatically resolves,\" but that's longer. \"Auto-resolves\" is commonly understood.\n\nTo make it more precise: \"Create a customer support automation workflow for a SaaS startup that triages tickets, resolves simple issues automatically, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance.\"\n\nWord count: Create (1), a (2), customer (3), support (4), automation (5), workflow (6), for (7), a (8), SaaS (9), startup (10), that (11), triages (12), tickets (13), resolves (14), simple (15), issues (16), automatically (17), escalates (18), complex (19), cases (20), and (21), tracks (22), performance (23). 23 words.\n\nThis is under 40, and it includes all elements. I think this works.\n\nBut let's ensure it's a single sentence. Yes, it is one sentence.\n\nFinal prompt: \"Create a customer support automation workflow for a SaaS startup that triages tickets, automatically resolves simple issues, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance.\"\n\nI'll go with this."
