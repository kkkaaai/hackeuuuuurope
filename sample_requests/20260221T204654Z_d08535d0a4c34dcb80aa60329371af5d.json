Let me start by breaking down the original query.\n\nFirst, the user specified a single-sentence prompt in plain English for a fintech content campaign. It needs to include research, multi-format creation, cross-channel consistency, and measurable goals, all under 45 words.\n\nI need to make sure each required element is addressed. Research means starting with an audit or analysis. Multi-format covers blogs, videos, and social posts. Consistency across channels implies a unified strategy. Measurable goals tie to specific KPIs like engagement or leads.\n\nNext, condensing all that into one concise sentence without exceeding the word limit. Using terms like \"end-to-end\" captures the comprehensive nature. Mentioning \"customer acquisition\" aligns with fintech objectives. Listing the content types ensures clarity on multi-format delivery. Finally, specifying KPIs like engagement and conversion makes the goals tangible.\n\nThe challenge is balancing detail with brevity. Each component must be included naturally. Avoiding jargon keeps it plain English. Checking the word count to stay under 45 ensures adherence to the user's request."
