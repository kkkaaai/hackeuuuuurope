The task needs to cover structured analysis, risk identification, compliance issues, proposed revisions, and both technical and executive summaries.\n\nOkay, I can focus on a common high-stakes scenario like a clinical trial protocol review. That involves checking for risks, compliance gaps, and suggesting fixes. The prompt should also specify the need for two types of summaries. \n\nLet me draft something tight: start with the action (\"review this draft\"), include the key elements (analysis, risks, compliance, revisions), and end with the deliverable (summaries). Yes, that fits under 45 words and covers all requirements."
