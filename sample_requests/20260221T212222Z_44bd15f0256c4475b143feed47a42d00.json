          "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants a single-sentence prompt in plain English. It must describe an end-to-end content campaign task in the education space. The task should involve research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals. Also, the output should only be the prompt text and be under 45 words.\n\nKey elements to include:\n- End-to-end content campaign task: This means the entire process from start to finish.\n- Education space: So it should be related to education, like teaching, learning, educational resources, etc.\n- Involves: Research, multi-format content creation (e.g., blog posts, videos, infographics), consistency across channels (like social media, email, website), and measurable goals (like engagement metrics, conversions).\n\nI need to craft a single sentence that encapsulates all these aspects concisely. Since it's a prompt, it should be directive, like a task description.\n\nLet me brainstorm a sentence: \"Create a comprehensive content campaign for an educational product that includes research, produces various content formats, ensures brand consistency across platforms, and sets clear performance metrics.\"\n\nNow, check the word count: \"Create a comprehensive content campaign for an educational product that includes research, produces various content formats, ensures brand consistency across platforms, and sets clear performance metrics.\" – Let's count: Create(1), a(2), comprehensive(3), content(4), campaign(5), for(6), an(7), educational(8), product(9), that(10), includes(11), research(12), produces(13), various(14), content(15), formats(16), ensures(17), brand(18), consistency(19), across(20), platforms(21), and(22), sets(23), clear(24), performance(25), metrics(26). That's 26 words, under 45. But is it under 45 words? Yes, 26 is less than 45.\n\nI need to ensure it's plain English and single sentence. This seems fine, but let me refine it to make it more natural and specific to the education space.\n\nAnother version: \"Develop an end-to-end content campaign for education that involves research, creating multi-format content, maintaining consistency across channels, and achieving measurable goals.\"\n\nWord count: Develop(1), an(2), end-to-end(3), content(4), campaign(5), for(6), education(7), that(8), involves(9), research(10), creating(11), multi-format(12), content(13), maintaining(14), consistency(15), across(16), channels(17), and(18), achieving(19), measurable(20), goals(21). 21 words.\n\nThis covers all the elements: research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals. It's in the education space, and it's end-to-end.\n\nI should make sure it's a task prompt, so perhaps start with a verb like \"Create\" or \"Develop\". The user said \"prompt describing an end-to-end content campaign task\", so it should be instructive.\n\nI think the second version is good. Let me confirm if it's under 45 words: Yes, 21 words.\n\nFinally, output only the prompt text. So, I'll just write the sentence without any additional explanation."
