The task needs to include defining requirements, building components, testing, fixing issues, and deploying to an environment.\n\nKey elements to cover:\n- Defining requirements\n- Building components\n- Testing\n- Fixing issues\n- Deploying to an environment\n\nAll this must be in one sentence under 45 words.\n\nI need to make it concise and realistic. Backend microservices often involve things like APIs, databases, service communication, etc.\n\nLet me brainstorm a task: For example, developing a user authentication microservice.\n\nNow, craft a sentence that includes all steps: Define requirements for a user auth service, build its components like API endpoints and database schemas, test it, fix any bugs, and deploy it to a staging environment.\n\nCount the words: \"Define requirements for a user authentication microservice, build its components, test thoroughly, fix any issues, and deploy to a staging environment.\" That's 20 words. But it's a bit generic.\n\nMake it more specific: \"Develop a backend microservice for processing payments by defining requirements, building APIs and database layers, testing integration, fixing bugs, and deploying to production.\" That's 24 words.\n\nCheck if all elements are included: Defining requirements – yes, building components – APIs and database layers, testing – integration testing, fixing issues – fixing bugs, deploying – to production. That seems comprehensive.\n\nEnsure it's under 45 words: My draft is 24 words, so it's fine.\n\nMake it a single sentence: Yes, it is one sentence.\n\nPlain English: Yes, it's straightforward.\n\nFinalize: \"Develop a payment processing microservice by outlining requirements, constructing APIs and database layers, performing integration tests, resolving defects, and deploying to a production environment.\" That's 22 words.\n\nI can simplify further: \"Create a user profile microservice by defining specs, building components, testing, fixing bugs, and deploying to cloud.\" That's 16 words.\n\nBut let's ensure it's realistic. Backend microservices often involve multiple steps. My first draft is good.\n\nOutput only the prompt text: So, in the response, I should just give the sentence without any additional text.\n\nHere's my final prompt:"
