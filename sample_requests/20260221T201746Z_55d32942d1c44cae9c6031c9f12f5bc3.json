The user asked for a single-sentence prompt under 45 words that includes research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals in healthcare.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure all required elements are covered. The key components are: healthcare space, research, multi-format content, channel consistency, and measurable goals. The prompt should be end-to-end, meaning it should encompass the entire campaign from start to finish.\n\nNext, considering the word limit. The response provided is 24 words, so it fits. I should check if each element is included. \"Research\" is mentioned, \"produce articles, infographics, and videos\" covers multi-format, \"consistent brand voice\" addresses consistency, and \"track engagement and lead generation\" handles measurable goals.\n\nAlso, the prompt starts with \"Develop a content campaign,\" which sets the context as an end-to-end task. The healthcare aspect is specified with \"targeting patients with diabetes.\" That makes it specific to the healthcare space while keeping it concise.\n\nI need to ensure the sentence flows naturally and remains under 45 words. Avoiding jargon to keep it plain-English. The response uses actionable verbs like \"research,\" \"produce,\" and \"track\" to clearly outline steps without being verbose."
