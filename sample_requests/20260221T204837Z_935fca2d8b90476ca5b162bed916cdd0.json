          "reasoning_content": "First, the task is to generate a single-sentence prompt in plain English. The prompt should describe a complex research and analysis task in quantum algorithms. The task must involve gathering information from multiple sources, synthesizing insights, handling uncertainty, and producing a structured deliverable. The output should be only the prompt text, and it must be under 45 words.\n\nI need to ensure that the prompt itself is a single sentence. It should be concise and clear, covering all the required elements.\n\nKey elements to include:\n- Complex research and analysis task in quantum algorithms.\n- Gathering information from multiple sources.\n- Synthesizing insights.\n- Handling uncertainty.\n- Producing a structured deliverable.\n\nI should craft a sentence that incorporates all these aspects without exceeding 45 words. Let me brainstorm some ideas.\n\nPossible prompt: \"Research recent advancements in quantum error correction, synthesize findings from academic papers and industry reports, address uncertainties in implementation, and produce a detailed comparative analysis report.\"\n\nLet's check the word count: \"Research recent advancements in quantum error correction, synthesize findings from academic papers and industry reports, address uncertainties in implementation, and produce a detailed comparative analysis report.\" That's 24 words. It covers gathering from multiple sources (academic papers and industry reports), synthesizing insights, handling uncertainty (address uncertainties), and producing a structured deliverable (comparative analysis report). However, it specifies \"quantum error correction,\" which is a subset of quantum algorithms. The task is about quantum algorithms in general, so I might want to keep it broader.\n\nAnother attempt: \"Compile and analyze diverse sources on quantum algorithm scalability, integrate insights while managing data inconsistencies, and deliver a structured review with recommendations.\"\n\nWord count: 16 words. It includes compiling diverse sources (gathering from multiple sources), analyzing and integrating insights (synthesizing insights), managing data inconsistencies (handling uncertainty), and delivering a structured review with recommendations (structured deliverable). But is it specific enough to quantum algorithms? Yes, \"quantum algorithm scalability\" is part of quantum algorithms.\n\nI need to make sure it's a complex research and analysis task. The prompt should imply complexity.\n\nLet me refine: \"Conduct a comprehensive study on quantum machine learning algorithms by aggregating data from research papers, patents, and expert interviews, synthesizing key trends, accounting for experimental uncertainties, and producing a structured technical whitepaper.\"\n\nWord count: 28 words. This seems comprehensive. It includes gathering from multiple sources (research papers, patents, expert interviews), synthesizing insights (synthesizing key trends), handling uncertainty (accounting for experimental uncertainties), and producing a structured deliverable (technical whitepaper). It's specific to quantum machine learning algorithms, which is a complex area within quantum algorithms.\n\nI should ensure it's a single sentence. Yes, all these are single sentences.\n\nNow, I need to output only the prompt text under 45 words. My refined prompt is 28 words, so it fits.\n\nBut let me confirm if it covers all elements adequately. \"Conduct a comprehensive study\" implies research and analysis. \"Aggregating data from multiple sources\" covers gathering. \"Synthesizing key trends\" covers synthesizing insights. \"Accounting for experimental uncertainties\" covers handling uncertainty. \"Producing a structured technical whitepaper\" covers structured deliverable. All good.\n\nI can make it even more concise. The instruction says \"under 45 words,\" so I have room, but I should keep it succinct.\n\nFinal prompt: \"Research quantum optimization algorithms from varied sources, synthesize insights while addressing uncertainties, and produce a structured report with analysis and recommendations.\"\n\nWord count: 18 words. This is shorter but still covers all aspects. However, \"varied sources\" might be vague, but it implies multiple sources. \"Addressing uncertainties\" covers handling uncertainty. \"Structured report with analysis and recommendations\" covers structured deliverable.\n\nI think the previous one with quantum machine learning is more specific and complex, but both are acceptable. Since the task is to describe a complex research and analysis task, I'll go with the more detailed one.\n\nTo save words, I can combine elements. For example: \"Gather and synthesize information from multiple sources on quantum algorithms, handle uncertainties in data, and deliver a structured analysis document.\"\n\nWord count: 20 words. This is general but covers all points. \"Gather and synthesize information from multiple sources\" covers gathering and synthesizing. \"Handle uncertainties in data\" covers handling uncertainty. \"Deliver a structured analysis document\" covers structured deliverable. But it doesn't specify the type of analysis or complexity. I should include \"complex research\" implicitly.\n\nI think the prompt should stand alone as a clear instruction. So, I'll use: \"Perform a complex analysis of quantum algorithm advancements by integrating data from diverse sources, synthesizing findings, managing uncertainties, and producing a structured review with actionable insights.\"\n\nWord count: 24 words. This seems comprehensive and meets all requirements.\n\nI'll go with this. Let me write it out.\n\nPrompt: \"Perform a complex analysis of quantum algorithm advancements by integrating data from diverse sources, synthesizing findings, managing uncertainties, and producing a structured review with actionable insights.\"\n\nCheck word count: Perform (1), a (2), complex (3), analysis (4), of (5), quantum (6), algorithm (7), advancements (8), by (9), integrating (10), data (11), from (12), diverse (13), sources (14), synthesizing (15), findings (16), managing (17), uncertainties (18), and (19), producing (20), a (21), structured (22), review (23), with (24), actionable (25), insights (26). 26 words. Under 45.\n\nIt is a single sentence, plain English, and covers all elements.\n\nI'll output this."
