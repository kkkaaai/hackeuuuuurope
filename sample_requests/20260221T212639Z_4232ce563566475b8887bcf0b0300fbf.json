          "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants a single-sentence prompt in plain English. It should describe a multi-case customer support automation workflow for a retail chain. The workflow must include triage, automatic resolution of simple issues, escalation of complex cases, and performance tracking.\n\nKey elements to cover:\n- Triage: This means sorting or categorizing customer support cases.\n- Automatic resolution of simple issues: Handling easy problems automatically without human intervention.\n- Escalation of complex cases: Sending more complicated issues to human agents or higher levels of support.\n- Performance tracking: Monitoring and analyzing the workflow's effectiveness.\n\nThe prompt needs to be under 40 words. I have to ensure it's concise and captures all these aspects.\n\nI need to craft a single sentence that flows naturally. Let me brainstorm a draft:\n\n\"Design a customer support automation system that triages inquiries, resolves simple issues automatically, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance metrics for a retail chain.\"\n\nNow, count the words: \"Design a customer support automation system that triages inquiries, resolves simple issues automatically, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance metrics for a retail chain.\" That's 20 words. Under 40, so it fits.\n\nBut let me check if it covers all elements: triage (triages inquiries), automatic resolution (resolves simple issues automatically), escalation (escalates complex cases), performance tracking (tracks performance metrics), and it's for a retail chain. Yes, it does.\n\nIs it a prompt? The user said \"prompt text,\" so it should be something that instructs or describes the workflow. This seems like a descriptive prompt that could be used to generate or implement such a system.\n\nI should make sure it's in plain English and straightforward. Perhaps I can make it more imperative. Since it's a prompt, it might be phrased as a command or request.\n\nThe user says \"Generate one single-sentence plain-English prompt,\" so I'm outputting the prompt text. So, my output should be just that sentence.\n\nFinal check: under 40 words. My draft is 20 words. I can refine it to be more precise, but it seems good.\n\nAnother version: \"Create an automated customer support workflow for retail that triages cases, auto-resolves simple issues, escalates complex ones, and tracks performance.\" Words: 18. Also covers all points.\n\nI'll go with the first one for clarity, but both are fine. Since the user said \"output only the prompt text,\" I'll provide the sentence without any additional explanation.\n\nSo, my response should be the prompt text alone."
