Let me break down their requirements.\n\nFirst, it needs to be plain English and under 45 words. The task must involve structured analysis, identifying risks or compliance issues, proposing revisions, and delivering technical and executive summaries. \n\nHmm, clinical trials... maybe focus on a critical document like a study protocol. That’s high-stakes because it involves patient safety and regulatory compliance. \n\nI should include all the elements: analyze, identify risks, propose changes, and summarize for both technical and executive audiences. Keep it concise. \n\nLet me draft a sentence: \"Analyze a clinical trial protocol to identify compliance risks, propose revisions, and create both technical and executive summaries.\" \n\nCheck the word count—14 words, under 45. Covers structured analysis (analyze the protocol), risks (compliance issues), revisions, and both summaries. Yeah, that fits."
