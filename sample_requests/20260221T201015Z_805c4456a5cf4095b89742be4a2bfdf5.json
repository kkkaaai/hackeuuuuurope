          "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants a single-sentence prompt in plain English. It should describe a multi-case customer support automation workflow for a SaaS startup. The workflow includes triage, automatic resolution of simple issues, escalation of complex cases, and performance tracking.\n\nKey elements to cover:\n- Triage: Sorting or categorizing customer issues.\n- Automatic resolution: Handling simple issues automatically.\n- Escalation: Sending complex cases to human agents.\n- Performance tracking: Monitoring and analyzing the workflow's effectiveness.\n\nThe prompt must be under 40 words. I need to ensure it's concise and includes all these aspects.\n\nLet me draft a sentence:\n\"Design a customer support workflow that triages tickets, auto-resolves simple issues, escalates complex ones, and tracks performance metrics for a SaaS startup.\"\n\nNow, count the words: Design (1), a (2), customer (3), support (4), workflow (5), that (6), triages (7), tickets (8), auto-resolves (9), simple (10), issues (11), escalates (12), complex (13), ones (14), and (15), tracks (16), performance (17), metrics (18), for (19), a (20), SaaS (21), startup (22). That's 22 words, which is under 40.\n\nBut let me check if it accurately reflects the multi-case aspect. The user said \"multi-case,\" which might imply handling different types of cases. My draft covers triage, which should handle multiple cases. Perhaps I can make it clearer.\n\nAnother draft: \"Create an automated support system for a SaaS startup that triages cases, resolves simple ones automatically, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance.\"\n\nWord count: Create (1), an (2), automated (3), support (4), system (5), for (6), a (7), SaaS (8), startup (9), that (10), triages (11), cases (12), resolves (13), simple (14), ones (15), automatically (16), escalates (17), complex (18), cases (19), and (20), tracks (21), performance (22). Still 22 words.\n\nI need to ensure it's a prompt, so it should be instructive. The user said \"prompt,\" so it should be something like \"Generate a workflow that...\" but since the user is asking for the prompt text, I should output the prompt itself.\n\nThe instruction is to \"output only the prompt text,\" so I'll just write the sentence.\n\nLet me refine to include \"multi-case\" explicitly: \"Design a multi-case customer support automation workflow for a SaaS startup involving triage, auto-resolution, escalation, and performance tracking.\"\n\nWord count: Design (1), a (2), multi-case (3), customer (4), support (5), automation (6), workflow (7), for (8), a (9), SaaS (10), startup (11), involving (12), triage (13), auto-resolution (14), escalation (15), and (16), performance (17), tracking (18). That's 18 words.\n\nThis covers all elements: multi-case, triage, auto-resolution (for simple issues), escalation (for complex cases), and performance tracking. It's concise and under 40 words.\n\nI'll go with this."
