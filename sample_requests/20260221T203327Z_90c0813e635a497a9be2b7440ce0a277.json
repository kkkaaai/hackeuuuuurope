          "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants a single-sentence plain-English prompt. That means it should be one sentence, in simple English, without jargon.\n\nThe prompt needs to describe an end-to-end content campaign task in the healthcare space. So, it's about a comprehensive content campaign, from start to finish, focused on healthcare.\n\nKey elements to include: research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals. I need to weave all these into one sentence.\n\nThe sentence must be under 45 words. I need to count the words to ensure it's concise.\n\nLet me outline the components:\n\n- End-to-end content campaign: This implies the entire process from planning to execution.\n\n- Healthcare space: Specify that it's in healthcare.\n\n- Research: Initial investigation or analysis.\n\n- Multi-format content creation: Creating content in various formats like articles, videos, infographics, etc.\n\n- Consistency across channels: Ensuring the message is uniform across different platforms (e.g., social media, website, email).\n\n- Measurable goals: Setting objectives that can be quantified, like engagement metrics or conversions.\n\nNow, combine these into one sentence. For example: \"Create a healthcare content campaign that involves research, producing various content formats, maintaining consistency across all channels, and achieving measurable goals.\"\n\nBut I need to make it more fluid and natural. Let me try a few versions.\n\nVersion 1: \"Develop an end-to-end healthcare content campaign requiring research, multi-format content creation, channel consistency, and measurable outcomes.\"\n\nWord count: 12 words. Under 45, but is it clear? It might be a bit terse.\n\nVersion 2: \"Design a comprehensive healthcare content campaign that includes research, creating content in multiple formats, ensuring consistency across channels, and setting measurable goals.\"\n\nWord count: 20 words. Still under 45, and it flows better.\n\nI can make it more engaging. Since it's a prompt, it should be directive.\n\nFinal version: \"Plan and execute a healthcare content campaign from research to multi-format creation, ensuring consistency across channels and meeting measurable goals.\"\n\nWord count: 18 words. Yes, this covers all aspects.\n\nLet me double-check: \"end-to-end\" is implied by \"from research to...\", and it includes all required elements.\n\nI think this works. Now, output only the prompt text."
