They need a single sentence under 45 words that includes defining requirements, building components, testing, fixing issues, and deploying. \n\nHmm, edge computing involves distributed systems, so maybe focusing on data collection at remote sites. The task should cover the whole lifecycle from planning to deployment. How about a scenario where sensors transmit data to a central server? \n\nI need to incorporate all the stages: defining specs, developing modules, unit testing, fixing bugs, and deploying to edge nodes. Let me check the word count. \"Design, build, test, debug, and deploy a system...\" that covers the key phases. Adding \"to collect and transmit sensor data from remote sites to a central server\" sets the edge context. \n\nYes, that fits within 45 words and includes all the required elements. It's realistic for edge computing too. The prompt is clear and actionable without being too vague."
