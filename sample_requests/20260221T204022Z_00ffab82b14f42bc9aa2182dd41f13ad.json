          "reasoning_content": "First, the task is to generate a single-sentence plain-English prompt. It needs to describe a high-stakes professional task in health data privacy. The task should involve structured analysis, identifying risks or compliance issues, proposing revisions, and delivering both technical and executive summaries.\n\nThe output should only be the prompt text, and it must be under 45 words. I need to ensure it's concise and meets all these criteria.\n\nLet me break down the requirements:\n- High-stakes professional task in health data privacy.\n- Requires structured analysis.\n- Identifying risks or compliance issues.\n- Proposing revisions.\n- Delivering both technical and executive summaries.\n\nI need to combine all these into one sentence that is under 45 words. I should avoid any additional text, just the prompt.\n\nStart by drafting a sentence: \"Analyze a health data breach incident to identify compliance gaps, assess risks, propose corrective actions, and provide technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nThat's 20 words. Let's check if it covers everything:\n- High-stakes: health data breach incident implies high stakes.\n- Structured analysis: implied in \"analyze.\"\n- Identifying risks or compliance issues: \"identify compliance gaps, assess risks.\"\n- Proposing revisions: \"propose corrective actions.\"\n- Delivering both technical and executive summaries: \"provide technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nIt seems to cover all points. But I can make it more specific to health data privacy. Perhaps mention HIPAA or other regulations.\n\nAnother draft: \"Conduct a structured analysis of a health data privacy violation, identify HIPAA compliance risks, propose policy revisions, and deliver both technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nThat's 22 words. Still under 45. It explicitly mentions HIPAA, which is relevant to health data privacy in the U.S.\n\nI need to ensure it's plain-English, so avoid jargon where possible. \"HIPAA\" is common in this context.\n\nFinal check: single sentence, under 45 words. Yes, both drafts are single sentences and under 45 words.\n\nI'll go with the second one as it directly mentions health data privacy and compliance. But let's see if I can make it even clearer.\n\n\"Perform a structured risk assessment on a health data system to uncover compliance issues, suggest improvements, and summarize findings for both technical and executive audiences.\"\n\nThat's 24 words. It covers structured analysis, identifying risks/compliance, proposing revisions (suggest improvements), and delivering summaries. But it doesn't explicitly say \"high-stakes.\" However, health data systems inherently involve high stakes due to privacy concerns.\n\nThe original requirement says \"high-stakes professional task,\" so I should incorporate that. Perhaps imply it through context.\n\nI think the first draft I had is fine. Let's refine it.\n\nPrompt: \"Analyze a critical health data privacy incident, identify compliance risks and gaps, propose corrective measures, and deliver both technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nThat's 20 words. It includes \"critical\" to imply high stakes.\n\nTo make it more precise: \"Evaluate a high-stakes health data privacy breach using structured analysis to identify compliance risks, propose revisions, and deliver technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nThat's 21 words. Yes.\n\nI'll use this as the final prompt. Ensure it's under 45 words: 21 words, so okay.\n\nOutput only the prompt text, so no additional explanation."
