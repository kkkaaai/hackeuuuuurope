          "reasoning_content": "First, the task is to generate a single-sentence plain-English prompt. It should describe a complex research and analysis task in quantum algorithms. The task must involve gathering information from multiple sources, synthesizing insights, handling uncertainty, and producing a structured deliverable.\n\nKey elements:\n- Single sentence: So, no multiple sentences or bullet points.\n- Plain-English: Use simple, clear language.\n- Under 45 words: I need to count the words to ensure compliance.\n- Content: Focus on quantum algorithms, with the specified components: gathering from multiple sources, synthesizing insights, handling uncertainty, and structured deliverable.\n\nI need to craft a prompt that encapsulates all these aspects concisely. Let me brainstorm a sentence.\n\nPossible structure: \"Research and analyze [topic] in quantum algorithms by gathering data from multiple sources, synthesizing insights, addressing uncertainties, and delivering a structured report.\"\n\nBut that might be too generic. I should make it more specific to quantum algorithms. For example, mention a particular area like quantum error correction, quantum machine learning, or quantum optimization.\n\nTo keep it general but specific enough, I can say: \"Conduct a comprehensive study on quantum algorithm advancements, integrating diverse sources, synthesizing findings, managing uncertainties, and producing a structured analysis document.\"\n\nNow, check the word count: \"Conduct a comprehensive study on quantum algorithm advancements, integrating diverse sources, synthesizing findings, managing uncertainties, and producing a structured analysis document.\" Let's count: Conduct(1), a(2), comprehensive(3), study(4), on(5), quantum(6), algorithm(7), advancements(8), integrating(9), diverse(10), sources(11), synthesizing(12), findings(13), managing(14), uncertainties(15), and(16), producing(17), a(18), structured(19), analysis(20), document(21). 21 words. Under 45, so that's fine.\n\nBut is it a single sentence? Yes, it's one sentence with a series of verbs.\n\nI need to ensure it's plain-English and describes a complex task. This seems okay, but I can make it more engaging or precise.\n\nAnother try: \"Gather information from multiple sources to research quantum algorithms, synthesize insights while handling uncertainty, and produce a structured deliverable such as a report or framework.\"\n\nWord count: Gather(1), information(2), from(3), multiple(4), sources(5), to(6), research(7), quantum(8), algorithms(9), synthesize(10), insights(11), while(12), handling(13), uncertainty(14), and(15), produce(16), a(17), structured(18), deliverable(19), such(20), as(21), a(22), report(23), or(24), framework(25). 25 words. Still under 45.\n\nBut the prompt says \"describing a complex research and analysis task,\" so I should emphasize that it's complex. Perhaps include words like \"complex\" or \"in-depth.\"\n\nFinal attempt: \"Perform a complex analysis of quantum algorithms by gathering data from varied sources, synthesizing insights to address uncertainties, and creating a structured deliverable like a detailed report.\"\n\nWord count: Perform(1), a(2), complex(3), analysis(4), of(5), quantum(6), algorithms(7), by(8), gathering(9), data(10), from(11), varied(12), sources(13), synthesizing(14), insights(15), to(16), address(17), uncertainties(18), and(19), creating(20), a(21), structured(22), deliverable(23), like(24), a(25), detailed(26), report(27). 27 words.\n\nThis covers all the elements: complex research, gathering from multiple sources (varied sources), synthesizing insights, handling uncertainty (address uncertainties), and producing a structured deliverable.\n\nI think this works. Now, I need to output only the prompt text, so no additional explanation.\n\nLet's write it cleanly."
