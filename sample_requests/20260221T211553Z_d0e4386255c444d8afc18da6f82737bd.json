          "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants a single-sentence prompt in plain English. It should describe a multi-case customer support automation workflow for a managed hosting provider. The workflow involves triage, automatic resolution of simple issues, escalation of complex cases, and performance tracking.\n\nKey elements to include:\n- Managed hosting provider context.\n- Workflow steps: triage, automatic resolution of simple issues, escalation of complex cases, performance tracking.\n- Must be a single sentence.\n- Plain English.\n- Under 40 words.\n\nI need to condense all these into one concise sentence. Let me brainstorm a draft.\n\nDraft 1: \"Automate customer support for a managed hosting provider by triaging tickets, resolving simple issues automatically, escalating complex cases, and tracking performance.\"\n\nNow, check the word count: \"Automate customer support for a managed hosting provider by triaging tickets, resolving simple issues automatically, escalating complex cases, and tracking performance.\" – That's 20 words. Under 40, so good.\n\nBut is it a prompt? The user said \"prompt describing a workflow,\" so this should be a prompt that someone could use to generate or implement such a workflow. However, the instruction is to output only the prompt text, so I think this is fine.\n\nMake sure it's plain English and single sentence. Yes, it is.\n\nLet me see if I can make it more precise. The user said \"multi-case,\" which might imply multiple types of cases. My draft covers that implicitly with triage and escalation.\n\nPerhaps: \"Create a support workflow that triages tickets, auto-resolves simple issues, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance for a managed hosting provider.\"\n\nWord count: \"Create a support workflow that triages tickets, auto-resolves simple issues, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance for a managed hosting provider.\" – 18 words.\n\nStill good. But the original said \"multi-case customer support automation workflow,\" so I should incorporate \"automation\" more explicitly. In my first draft, I used \"Automate customer support,\" which covers automation.\n\nAnother version: \"Design an automated support workflow for managed hosting that triages cases, resolves simple issues automatically, escalates complex ones, and tracks performance metrics.\"\n\nWord count: \"Design an automated support workflow for managed hosting that triages cases, resolves simple issues automatically, escalates complex ones, and tracks performance metrics.\" – 19 words.\n\nThis seems clear and includes all elements.\n\nI'll go with one of these. Since the user said \"output only the prompt text,\" I need to choose one.\n\nFinal decision: Use a concise version that includes all key points.\n\n\"Automate managed hosting support by triaging tickets, auto-fixing simple issues, escalating complex cases, and tracking performance.\"\n\nWord count: \"Automate managed hosting support by triaging tickets, auto-fixing simple issues, escalating complex cases, and tracking performance.\" – 13 words. Includes all elements: triage, automatic resolution, escalation, performance tracking, and context of managed hosting.\n\nYes, this works."
