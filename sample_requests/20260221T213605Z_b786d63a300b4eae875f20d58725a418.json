          "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants me to generate a single-sentence prompt in plain English. The prompt should describe a high-stakes professional task in financial audits. This task must involve structured analysis, identifying risks or compliance issues, proposing revisions, and delivering both technical and executive summaries.\n\nKey elements from the user's request:\n- Single sentence: So, I need to write one coherent sentence.\n- Plain English: Use simple, clear language without jargon if possible.\n- High-stakes professional task in financial audits: This sets the context. Financial audits are serious, so tasks might involve critical review processes.\n- Requires structured analysis: This means a methodical, organized approach to examining data or processes.\n- Identifying risks or compliance issues: This involves spotting potential problems or violations of regulations.\n- Proposing revisions: Suggesting changes or improvements.\n- Delivering both technical and executive summaries: Providing detailed summaries for experts and high-level summaries for decision-makers.\n- Output only the prompt text: I shouldn't add any extra commentary or explanation.\n- Under 45 words: I need to count the words to ensure the prompt is concise.\n\nI need to craft a sentence that encapsulates all these elements. Let me brainstorm a draft:\n\n\"Analyze audit findings through structured methods to identify risks and compliance gaps, propose corrective revisions, and prepare both detailed technical and concise executive summaries.\"\n\nNow, check the word count: \"Analyze audit findings through structured methods to identify risks and compliance gaps, propose corrective revisions, and prepare both detailed technical and concise executive summaries.\" – That's 20 words. Under 45, so it fits.\n\nBut is it high-stakes? The task is in financial audits, which are inherently high-stakes, so mentioning \"audit findings\" should imply that. Also, \"structured analysis\" is covered by \"structured methods.\" I have all the required components: structured analysis, identifying risks/compliance issues, proposing revisions, and delivering both summaries.\n\nLet me ensure it's a single sentence and flows well. Perhaps I can make it more specific to financial audits. For example: \"Conduct a structured analysis of financial audit data to pinpoint risks and compliance violations, suggest revisions, and provide technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nWord count: \"Conduct a structured analysis of financial audit data to pinpoint risks and compliance violations, suggest revisions, and provide technical and executive summaries.\" – 18 words.\n\nI think the first draft is fine, but I'll refine it to sound more professional and concise.\n\nFinal prompt: \"Perform structured analysis on financial audit results to identify risks and compliance issues, propose revisions, and deliver both technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nWord count: 18 words. Meets all criteria.\n\nI'll go with this."
