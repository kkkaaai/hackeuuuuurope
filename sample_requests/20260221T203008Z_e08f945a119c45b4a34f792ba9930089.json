          "reasoning_content": "First, the task is to generate a single-sentence plain-English prompt. It must describe a complex research and analysis task in quantum algorithms. The task should involve gathering information from multiple sources, synthesizing insights, handling uncertainty, and producing a structured deliverable.\n\nThe prompt should be under 45 words, and I need to output only the prompt text.\n\nKey elements from the instruction:\n- Single sentence: so no multiple sentences or bullet points.\n- Plain-English: use simple, clear language.\n- Complex research and analysis task in quantum algorithms: the topic is specific to quantum algorithms.\n- Requirements: gathering from multiple sources, synthesizing insights, handling uncertainty, producing structured deliverable.\n- Under 45 words: I need to count the words to ensure it's within limit.\n\nI need to craft a sentence that incorporates all these elements. Let me brainstorm a possible prompt.\n\nExample structure: \"Research and analyze [specific aspect] in quantum algorithms by gathering data from multiple sources, synthesizing findings to handle uncertainties, and deliver a structured report.\"\n\nBut I need to make it more natural and concise. Since it's complex, I should mention the complexity.\n\nLet me try drafting:\n\n\"Conduct a comprehensive study on quantum algorithm optimization, integrating insights from various research papers, addressing inherent uncertainties, and compiling a detailed analysis report.\"\n\nNow, check the word count: \"Conduct a comprehensive study on quantum algorithm optimization, integrating insights from various research papers, addressing inherent uncertainties, and compiling a detailed analysis report.\" Words: Conduct, a, comprehensive, study, on, quantum, algorithm, optimization, integrating, insights, from, various, research, papers, addressing, inherent, uncertainties, and, compiling, a, detailed, analysis, report. That's 23 words. Under 45, so good.\n\nBut does it include all elements? Gathering from multiple sources: \"various research papers\" covers that. Synthesizing insights: \"integrating insights\" implies synthesis. Handling uncertainty: \"addressing inherent uncertainties\" covers that. Producing structured deliverable: \"compiling a detailed analysis report\" is a structured deliverable. And it's about quantum algorithms: \"quantum algorithm optimization\" is part of quantum algorithms.\n\nHowever, the prompt says \"describing a complex research and analysis task,\" so my draft seems to fit. But let me see if I can make it more precise or natural.\n\nAnother attempt: \"Perform a multi-source analysis of recent advances in quantum error correction algorithms, synthesize key insights while managing uncertainties, and produce a structured technical briefing.\"\n\nWord count: Perform, a, multi-source, analysis, of, recent, advances, in, quantum, error, correction, algorithms, synthesize, key, insights, while, managing, uncertainties, and, produce, a, structured, technical, briefing. That's 24 words. Still under 45.\n\nThis includes gathering from multiple sources via \"multi-source analysis,\" synthesizing insights, handling uncertainty via \"managing uncertainties,\" and producing a structured deliverable via \"structured technical briefing.\" It's specific to quantum algorithms with \"quantum error correction algorithms.\"\n\nI think this works. But let me ensure it's a single sentence. Both drafts are single sentences with clauses connected by commas and conjunctions.\n\nI should output only the prompt text, so no additional explanation.\n\nI'll choose one that best fits all criteria. Perhaps combine elements.\n\nFinal prompt: \"Research quantum annealing algorithms by consolidating data from diverse sources, synthesizing insights to address uncertainties, and delivering a structured comparative analysis.\"\n\nWord count: Research, quantum, annealing, algorithms, by, consolidating, data, from, diverse, sources, synthesizing, insights, to, address, uncertainties, and, delivering, a, structured, comparative, analysis. 21 words.\n\nYes, this includes all: gathering from diverse sources, synthesizing insights, handling uncertainties, and producing a structured deliverable (comparative analysis). It's about quantum algorithms (quantum annealing algorithms).\n\nI think this is good. I'll go with this.\n\nBut let me confirm: is it complex? Yes, quantum annealing algorithms are a complex topic, and the task involves consolidation, synthesis, and addressing uncertainties, which adds complexity.\n\nAlso, the prompt is in plain-English and under 45 words.\n\nSo, I'll output this prompt."
