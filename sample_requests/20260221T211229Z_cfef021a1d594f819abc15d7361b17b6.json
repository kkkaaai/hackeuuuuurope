Let me break down the original query first.\n\nThe user asked for a single-sentence prompt under 45 words that covers an end-to-end content campaign in manufacturing. It needs to include research, multi-format content creation, cross-channel consistency, and measurable goals. \n\nHmm, I should start by identifying the key elements the prompt must hit: manufacturing context, research, varied content types, unified messaging, and KPIs. Next, ensuring it's concise and flows naturally as one sentence. \n\nI might consider structuring it with the core action first (\"Create a content campaign\"), then weaving in the requirements. Mentioning specific formats like blog posts and videos adds clarity. Emphasizing consistency and measurable outcomes ties it all together. \n\nWait, did I keep it under 45 words? Let me check. The final prompt is exactly 33 words, so that fits. Avoiding jargon makes it accessible while hitting all the user's points. Yeah, that should cover it."
