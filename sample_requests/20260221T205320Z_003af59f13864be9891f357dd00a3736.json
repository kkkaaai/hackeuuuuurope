          "reasoning_content": "First, the task is to generate a single-sentence plain-English prompt. It should describe a complex research and analysis task in supply-chain resilience. The prompt needs to include specific elements: gathering information from multiple sources, synthesizing insights, handling uncertainty, and producing a structured deliverable.\n\nKey requirements:\n- Single sentence: So, no bullet points or multiple sentences.\n- Plain-English: Use simple, clear language.\n- Under 45 words: I need to count the words to ensure compliance.\n- Content: Focus on supply-chain resilience, involving complex research and analysis.\n\nElements to incorporate:\n1. Gathering information from multiple sources.\n2. Synthesizing insights.\n3. Handling uncertainty.\n4. Producing a structured deliverable.\n\nI need to weave these into a cohesive sentence about supply-chain resilience.\n\nLet me brainstorm a prompt:\n\n\"Analyze supply-chain resilience by gathering data from various sources, synthesizing insights to address uncertainties, and creating a structured report.\"\n\nBut I need to make it more specific to complex research and analysis. Also, ensure it's under 45 words.\n\nCount the words in that draft: \"Analyze supply-chain resilience by gathering data from various sources, synthesizing insights to address uncertainties, and creating a structured report.\" – That's 16 words. Well under 45, but I should make it more comprehensive.\n\nAnother attempt: \"Conduct a comprehensive analysis of supply-chain resilience by collecting information from multiple sources, synthesizing key insights while managing uncertainties, and delivering a structured actionable plan.\"\n\nWord count: 18 words. Still good.\n\nTo make it more complex: \"Research and analyze supply-chain resilience through multi-source data gathering, insight synthesis under uncertainty, and production of a structured strategic framework.\"\n\nThat's 17 words.\n\nI need to ensure it's a single sentence and plain-English. All these are single sentences.\n\nLet me refine: \"Perform a complex research task on supply-chain resilience that involves gathering information from multiple sources, synthesizing insights, handling uncertainty, and producing a structured deliverable.\"\n\nWord count: 22 words. This directly incorporates all elements, but it might sound a bit repetitive. I can make it more fluid.\n\nFinal idea: \"Investigate supply-chain resilience by gathering data from diverse sources, synthesizing insights to navigate uncertainties, and compiling a structured analysis report.\"\n\nWord count: 16 words.\n\nI think this meets all criteria. Now, I'll output only the prompt text.\n\nEnsure it's under 45 words: Yes, all versions are under 45 words.\n\nI'll go with: \"Research supply-chain resilience by collecting data from multiple sources, synthesizing insights to manage uncertainty, and producing a structured deliverable.\"\n\nBut to make it more engaging: \"Analyze supply-chain resilience through multi-source data collection, insight synthesis under uncertainty, and creation of a structured report.\"\n\nI think the key is to have all elements included.\n\nLet's write the final prompt:"
