          "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants a single-sentence prompt in plain English. It needs to describe a multi-case customer support automation workflow for a retail chain. The workflow involves triage, automatic resolution of simple issues, escalation of complex cases, and performance tracking.\n\nKey elements to include:\n- Triage: This is the initial sorting or categorization of customer issues.\n- Automatic resolution of simple issues: Some issues can be resolved automatically without human intervention.\n- Escalation of complex cases: More complicated issues should be escalated to human agents or higher-level support.\n- Performance tracking: Monitoring and measuring the effectiveness of the workflow.\n\nThe prompt must be under 40 words. I need to condense all these into one sentence.\n\nI should start by drafting a sentence that covers all points. For example: \"Create an automated customer support workflow that triages inquiries, resolves simple issues automatically, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance metrics.\"\n\nNow, check the word count: \"Create an automated customer support workflow that triages inquiries, resolves simple issues automatically, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance metrics.\" Let's count: Create (1), an (2), automated (3), customer (4), support (5), workflow (6), that (7), triages (8), inquiries (9), resolves (10), simple (11), issues (12), automatically (13), escalates (14), complex (15), cases (16), and (17), tracks (18), performance (19), metrics (20). So 20 words, which is under 40.\n\nBut I need to ensure it's for a retail chain. The prompt should specify that. So I can adjust: \"Design a retail customer support automation workflow that triages cases, auto-resolves simple issues, escalates complex ones, and tracks performance.\"\n\nWord count: Design (1), a (2), retail (3), customer (4), support (5), automation (6), workflow (7), that (8), triages (9), cases (10), auto-resolves (11), simple (12), issues (13), escalates (14), complex (15), ones (16), and (17), tracks (18), performance (19). 19 words.\n\nI used \"auto-resolves\" to save words, but it might be better as \"automatically resolves\" for plain English. However, \"auto-resolves\" is commonly understood and keeps it concise.\n\nAnother version: \"Develop an automated support system for retail that triages queries, solves simple issues automatically, escalates tough cases, and monitors performance.\"\n\nWord count: Develop (1), an (2), automated (3), support (4), system (5), for (6), retail (7), that (8), triages (9), queries (10), solves (11), simple (12), issues (13), automatically (14), escalates (15), tough (16), cases (17), and (18), monitors (19), performance (20). 20 words.\n\nI think the first draft is good, but I'll refine it to be more precise.\n\nFinal prompt: \"Create a retail customer support automation workflow that triages inquiries, automatically resolves simple issues, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance metrics.\"\n\nWord count: Create (1), a (2), retail (3), customer (4), support (5), automation (6), workflow (7), that (8), triages (9), inquiries (10), automatically (11), resolves (12), simple (13), issues (14), escalates (15), complex (16), cases (17), and (18), tracks (19), performance (20), metrics (21). 21 words. Still under 40.\n\nI should ensure it's a single sentence. Yes, it is.\n\nThe user said \"output only the prompt text,\" so I shouldn't include any other text. Just the prompt.\n\nI'll go with this: \"Design a retail customer support automation workflow that triages cases, auto-resolves simple issues, escalates complex ones, and tracks performance.\"\n\nBut to make it more descriptive, I can use: \"Automate retail customer support by triaging cases, resolving simple issues automatically, escalating complex ones, and tracking performance.\"\n\nWord count: Automate (1), retail (2), customer (3), support (4), by (5), triaging (6), cases (7), resolving (8), simple (9), issues (10), automatically (11), escalating (12), complex (13), ones (14), and (15), tracking (16), performance (17). 17 words.\n\nThis is concise and covers all elements. I'll use this."
