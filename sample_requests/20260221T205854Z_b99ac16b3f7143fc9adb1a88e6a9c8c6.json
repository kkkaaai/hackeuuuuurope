          "reasoning_content": "First, the task is to generate a single-sentence plain-English prompt. It should describe a complex research and analysis task in climate adaptation. The task must involve gathering information from multiple sources, synthesizing insights, handling uncertainty, and producing a structured deliverable. The output should only be the prompt text, and it must be under 45 words.\n\nKey elements to include:\n- Complex research and analysis task in climate adaptation.\n- Gathering information from multiple sources.\n- Synthesizing insights.\n- Handling uncertainty.\n- Producing a structured deliverable.\n\nThe prompt needs to be in plain English, meaning clear and straightforward language without jargon.\n\nI need to ensure it's a single sentence. That means no multiple sentences separated by periods; it should be one cohesive sentence.\n\nWord count: under 45 words. I'll count the words as I draft.\n\nLet me brainstorm a few ideas:\n\n- \"Research and analyze climate adaptation strategies by gathering data from various sources, synthesizing findings, addressing uncertainties, and creating a structured report.\"\n\nBut this might be too vague. I need to make it more specific to climate adaptation.\n\nPerhaps: \"Compile and assess multiple sources on coastal flood resilience, synthesize key insights while accounting for data uncertainties, and produce a structured adaptation plan.\"\n\nThat's one sentence, but let's check the word count: \"Compile and assess multiple sources on coastal flood resilience, synthesize key insights while accounting for data uncertainties, and produce a structured adaptation plan.\" – 20 words. Good.\n\nBut is it complex enough? It mentions \"coastal flood resilience\" which is a specific aspect of climate adaptation. It covers gathering from multiple sources, synthesizing insights, handling uncertainty (accounting for data uncertainties), and producing a structured deliverable (adaptation plan).\n\nI can refine it to make it more comprehensive.\n\nAnother attempt: \"Integrate data from scientific studies, policy documents, and community inputs to synthesize a resilient urban heat island adaptation strategy, handling uncertainties, and delivering a structured action plan.\"\n\nWord count: \"Integrate data from scientific studies, policy documents, and community inputs to synthesize a resilient urban heat island adaptation strategy, handling uncertainties, and delivering a structured action plan.\" – 24 words.\n\nThis seems good. It specifies the sources: scientific studies, policy documents, community inputs. The task is to synthesize an adaptation strategy for urban heat islands, handle uncertainties, and deliver a structured action plan.\n\nI need to ensure it's a single sentence. Yes, it is.\n\nNow, let's verify the requirements: complex research and analysis task in climate adaptation – yes, urban heat island adaptation is a climate adaptation topic. Gathering from multiple sources – scientific studies, policy documents, community inputs. Synthesizing insights – synthesizing a resilient strategy. Handling uncertainty – handling uncertainties. Producing structured deliverable – delivering a structured action plan.\n\nWord count is under 45. I'll go with this.\n\nBut let's make sure it's plain English. It uses terms like \"integrate data,\" \"synthesize,\" \"resilient,\" \"adaptation strategy,\" \"uncertainties,\" \"structured action plan.\" These are fairly common in research contexts, but still plain English.\n\nI can simplify if needed, but it should be acceptable.\n\nFinal prompt: \"Integrate data from scientific studies, policy documents, and community inputs to synthesize a resilient urban heat island adaptation strategy, handling uncertainties, and delivering a structured action plan.\"\n\nTo make it more concise, I can say: \"Synthesize a resilient urban heat island adaptation strategy by integrating data from multiple sources, handling uncertainties, and producing a structured action plan.\"\n\nWord count: \"Synthesize a resilient urban heat island adaptation strategy by integrating data from multiple sources, handling uncertainties, and producing a structured action plan.\" – 18 words. But this loses the specificity of the sources. The original prompt asked for \"gathering information from multiple sources,\" so specifying sources might be better.\n\nHowever, the instruction doesn't require specifying the types of sources, just that it involves multiple sources. So I can keep it general.\n\nBut to make it complex, specifying sources adds depth. I'll stick with the first refined version.\n\nI think I have a good prompt. Let me write it out."
