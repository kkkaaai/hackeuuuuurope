Let me break down the requirements: it needs to cover triage, automatic resolution of simple issues, escalation of complex cases, and performance tracking.\n\nOkay, starting with \"Design a workflow\" to set the action. Then \"that sorts incoming support tickets\" handles the triage part. For automation, \"automatically fixes common problems\" covers simple issues. Escalation can be phrased as \"routes tricky ones to humans.\" Finally, adding \"while tracking response times and resolutions\" captures performance tracking. \n\nChecking the word count: that’s exactly 21 words. The sentence flows naturally and includes all the key elements. It’s plain English and stays under the limit."
