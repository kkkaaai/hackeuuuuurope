The prompt needs to involve gathering multiple sources, synthesizing insights, handling uncertainty, and producing a structured deliverable—all under 45 words.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure each specified element is included. \"Gathering from multiple sources\" suggests referencing various materials. \"Synthesizing insights\" means combining information to form new conclusions. \"Handling uncertainty\" could relate to ambiguous data or conflicting findings. \"Structured deliverable\" implies a clear output format, like a report or annotated bibliography.\n\nQuantum algorithms are a broad field, so the prompt should be specific yet open-ended. Maybe focus on a current challenge, like error correction or algorithmic advantages. Need to avoid jargon to keep it plain English. Let me count the words to stay under 45. The current draft mentions gathering info, evaluating progress, addressing challenges, and producing an annotated report. That covers all points concisely."
