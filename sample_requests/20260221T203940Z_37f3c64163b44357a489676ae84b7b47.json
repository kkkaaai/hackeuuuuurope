Let me break down the requirements: needs structured analysis, risk/compliance identification, revisions, and dual summaries. \n\nOkay, professional tone is key given the finance context. Can combine all elements into one fluid instruction. \n\n\"Analyze\" covers structured approach, \"detect risks/compliance gaps\" hits the identification part, \"recommend edits\" addresses revisions, \"prepare detailed and executive summaries\" fulfills the dual reporting need. \n\nCounting the words... 23. Under limit. Sentence flows naturally while being directive. This should work."
