          "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants a single-sentence prompt in plain English. It should describe a realistic software engineering task in an ML pipeline. The task must include defining requirements, building components, testing, fixing issues, and deploying to an environment.\n\nKey elements to cover:\n- Defining requirements\n- Building components\n- Testing\n- Fixing issues\n- Deploying to an environment\n\nThe prompt should be under 45 words. I need to ensure it's concise and fits within the word limit.\n\nI'll structure the sentence to flow naturally from requirements to deployment, incorporating all the specified steps.\n\nExample idea: \"Develop an ML model for customer churn prediction by gathering requirements, building and testing components, debugging issues, and deploying to production.\"\n\nLet me check the word count: \"Develop an ML model for customer churn prediction by gathering requirements, building and testing components, debugging issues, and deploying to production.\" That's 18 words. It covers defining requirements (gathering requirements), building components (building components), testing (testing components), fixing issues (debugging issues), and deploying (deploying to production). But \"debugging issues\" might not fully capture \"fixing issues\" – debugging is part of fixing, so it should be fine.\n\nI need to make sure it's realistic and specific to ML pipeline. Customer churn prediction is a common ML task.\n\nAnother option: \"Create a sentiment analysis pipeline that involves specifying requirements, developing modules, rigorous testing, resolving bugs, and launching to a cloud environment.\"\n\nWord count: \"Create a sentiment analysis pipeline that involves specifying requirements, developing modules, rigorous testing, resolving bugs, and launching to a cloud environment.\" That's 22 words.\n\nBut I need to ensure it's a single sentence. Both examples are single sentences.\n\nThe user said \"output only the prompt text\", so I should just provide the prompt without any additional text.\n\nFinalize a version: \"Build an image classification system by defining data and model requirements, coding and testing components, fixing errors, and deploying to a staging environment.\"\n\nWord count: \"Build an image classification system by defining data and model requirements, coding and testing components, fixing errors, and deploying to a staging environment.\" That's 22 words.\n\nThis includes all elements: defining requirements (data and model requirements), building components (coding components), testing (testing components), fixing issues (fixing errors), and deploying (deploying to a staging environment).\n\nIt's under 45 words, so it meets the requirement.\n\nI'll go with this."
