          "reasoning_content": "First, the task is to generate a single-sentence prompt in plain English. It should describe a complex research and analysis task in supply-chain resilience. The prompt needs to include: gathering information from multiple sources, synthesizing insights, handling uncertainty, and producing a structured deliverable.\n\nKey elements to cover:\n- **Complex research and analysis task**: This implies it's not simple; it involves in-depth work.\n- **Supply-chain resilience**: The specific domain.\n- **Gathering from multiple sources**: So, the prompt should mention collecting data or information from various places.\n- **Synthesizing insights**: Combining information to form new understandings.\n- **Handling uncertainty**: Dealing with incomplete or ambiguous data.\n- **Producing a structured deliverable**: Output should be organized, like a report or plan.\n\nThe prompt must be under 45 words. I need to ensure it's concise and fits within a single sentence.\n\nStructure the sentence to flow naturally. Start with the action, then the components.\n\nPossible structure: \"Analyze supply-chain resilience by gathering data from multiple sources, synthesizing insights to handle uncertainty, and producing a structured deliverable.\" But this might be too vague. It needs to sound like a complex task.\n\nBetter: \"Conduct a comprehensive analysis of supply-chain resilience that involves collecting information from diverse sources, integrating findings to manage uncertainties, and delivering a structured report.\"\n\nCheck word count: \"Conduct a comprehensive analysis of supply-chain resilience that involves collecting information from diverse sources, integrating findings to manage uncertainties, and delivering a structured report.\" That's 22 words. Good.\n\nBut is it complex enough? I can add \"research and analysis\" to emphasize complexity. Also, \"handling uncertainty\" is specified, so \"manage uncertainties\" works.\n\nRefine: \"Perform a complex research and analysis task on supply-chain resilience by gathering data from multiple sources, synthesizing insights to handle uncertainty, and producing a structured deliverable.\" That's 24 words.\n\nTo make it more natural: \"Assess supply-chain resilience through multi-source data collection, insight synthesis to address uncertainties, and creation of a structured deliverable.\" That's 18 words.\n\nI need to ensure it's a single sentence. All versions are single sentences.\n\nFinally, output only the prompt text. So, no additional explanation.\n\nFinal prompt: \"Analyze supply-chain resilience by gathering information from multiple sources, synthesizing insights to handle uncertainty, and producing a structured deliverable.\"\n\nWord count: 14 words. Under 45, so it's fine.\n\nBut let's make it more descriptive: \"Conduct a comprehensive supply-chain resilience analysis that requires collecting data from various sources, synthesizing insights to manage uncertainty, and delivering a structured report.\" 20 words.\n\nI think this captures all elements."
