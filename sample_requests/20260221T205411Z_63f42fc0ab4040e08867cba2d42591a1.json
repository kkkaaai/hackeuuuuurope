They mentioned defining requirements, building components, testing, fixing issues, and deploying. All in one sentence under 45 words. Edge computing means involving devices closer to data sources, not just cloud. \n\nI need to include all those phases without making it too vague. Maybe mention specific components like data processor and deployment to a real-world environment. Testing and fixing should be implied but not overly detailed. \n\nHow about starting with requirements gathering for data ingestion, then building the processor, testing it for robustness, and finally deploying to edge gateways? That covers each step. Let me check the word count. Yes, it fits under 45. The example uses an IoT context which is common in edge computing."
