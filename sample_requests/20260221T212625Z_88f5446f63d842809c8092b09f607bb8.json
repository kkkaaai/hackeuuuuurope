Let me break down the requirements: triage, auto-resolution for simple issues, escalation for complex cases, and performance tracking. \n\nI need to ensure all four elements are included while keeping it natural-sounding. The word limit is tight, so avoiding fluff is key. Maybe start with the workflow's purpose, then list the components in a logical flow. \n\n\"Retail customer support workflow\" sets the context. \"Auto-resolves simple queries\" covers triage and resolution. \"Escalates complex cases\" handles escalation. \"Tracks performance metrics\" completes the tracking part. That’s 17 words—fits the limit and captures everything."
