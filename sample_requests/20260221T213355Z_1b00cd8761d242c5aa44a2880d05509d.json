          "reasoning_content": "First, the task is to generate a single-sentence prompt in plain English. It should describe a high-stakes professional task in health data privacy. The task must involve structured analysis, identifying risks or compliance issues, proposing revisions, and delivering both technical and executive summaries.\n\nKey elements from the instruction:\n- Single sentence\n- Plain English\n- High-stakes professional task in health data privacy\n- Requires structured analysis\n- Identifying risks or compliance issues\n- Proposing revisions\n- Delivering both technical and executive summaries\n\nThe prompt should be under 45 words. I need to output only the prompt text.\n\nNow, I need to condense all these elements into one sentence. Let me brainstorm a bit:\n\n- High-stakes professional task: Could be something like auditing a system, assessing compliance, or managing a data breach.\n- Health data privacy: Involves HIPAA, PHI (Protected Health Information), or similar regulations.\n- Structured analysis: Systematic review or evaluation.\n- Identifying risks/compliance issues: Spotting vulnerabilities or non-compliance.\n- Proposing revisions: Suggesting changes to policies or systems.\n- Delivering summaries: Both technical (for experts) and executive (for management).\n\nCombine into one sentence: \"Analyze our health data security framework to identify compliance gaps, propose corrective actions, and provide both technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nCheck word count: \"Analyze our health data security framework to identify compliance gaps, propose corrective actions, and provide both technical and executive summaries.\" That's 18 words. But it needs to specify high-stakes and structured analysis. \"High-stakes\" might be implied by the context of health data privacy, but I should make it clear.\n\nAnother attempt: \"Conduct a structured analysis of our patient data privacy measures to assess risks, recommend improvements, and deliver technical and executive summaries.\" Word count: 20 words.\n\nInclude \"high-stakes\": Since health data privacy is inherently high-stakes, it might not need explicit mention. But to be safe, I can incorporate it.\n\nThe instruction says \"describing a high-stakes professional task,\" so the prompt should reflect that. Perhaps use words like \"critical\" or \"urgent.\"\n\nFinal prompt: \"Perform a structured risk assessment of our health data privacy protocols to identify compliance issues, propose revisions, and deliver both technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nWord count: 18 words. Under 45, so it's fine.\n\nBut let's ensure it covers all points: structured analysis (structured risk assessment), identifying risks or compliance issues (identify compliance issues), proposing revisions (propose revisions), and delivering summaries (deliver both technical and executive summaries). It's in health data privacy. Yes.\n\nTo make it more high-stakes, I could add \"critical\" or \"high-stakes.\" For example: \"Conduct a critical structured analysis of our health data privacy system to uncover risks, suggest fixes, and provide technical and executive summaries.\" Word count: 21.\n\nI think the first version is adequate. But let's refine: \"Analyze our health data privacy framework through structured assessment to identify risks and compliance gaps, propose revisions, and deliver both technical and executive summaries.\" Word count: 22.\n\nI'll go with a concise version. The user said \"output only the prompt text,\" so I need to provide the sentence without any additional text.\n\nFinal decision: \"Conduct a structured analysis of our health data privacy practices to identify risks, propose compliance revisions, and deliver both technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nWord count: 20 words. Meets all requirements.\n\nI'll output that."
