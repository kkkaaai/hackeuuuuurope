Let me break down the requirements: it needs to involve structured analysis, risk/compliance identification, proposing revisions, and delivering both technical and executive summaries.\n\nOkay, focusing on a core audit scenario where these elements naturally come together. Forensic audit of vendor contracts comes to mind—it’s high-stakes, requires digging into details, and demands clear communication to different audiences.\n\nNow, fitting it all into one tight sentence: \"Analyze vendor contracts for fraud risks, propose control revisions, and summarize findings for both auditors and the board.\" That hits structured analysis (contract review), risk identification (fraud risks), revisions (control improvements), and dual summaries. Word count? Exactly 16 words. Perfect."
