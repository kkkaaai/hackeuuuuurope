          "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants a single-sentence plain-English prompt. That means it should be one sentence, in simple English, without jargon.\n\nThe prompt needs to describe a high-stakes professional task in health data privacy. So, the context is health data privacy, which is critical because it involves sensitive information.\n\nThe task must require structured analysis, identifying risks or compliance issues, proposing revisions, and delivering both technical and executive summaries. I need to incorporate all these elements into the prompt.\n\nThe output should only be the prompt text, and it must be under 45 words. I need to count the words to ensure compliance.\n\nLet me draft a prompt that includes all these components:\n\n- High-stakes professional task: Something like \"audit a healthcare data breach response plan\" or \"evaluate a patient data sharing agreement.\"\n\n- Structured analysis: Imply that a methodical approach is needed.\n\n- Identifying risks or compliance issues: Mention risks or compliance gaps.\n\n- Proposing revisions: Suggest changes or improvements.\n\n- Delivering both technical and executive summaries: Include summaries for different audiences.\n\nCombine all into one sentence. For example: \"Analyze the data security protocol for a hospital's electronic health records system to identify compliance gaps, propose enhancements, and provide both technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nNow, check the word count: \"Analyze the data security protocol for a hospital's electronic health records system to identify compliance gaps, propose enhancements, and provide both technical and executive summaries.\" That's 22 words. Under 45, so good.\n\nBut is it high-stakes? Health data privacy is inherently high-stakes, but I can make it more explicit. Maybe mention \"high-risk\" or \"critical.\"\n\nAnother draft: \"Conduct a structured analysis of a clinic's patient data privacy measures, pinpoint risks and compliance violations, recommend fixes, and deliver technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nWord count: 20 words. Still under 45.\n\nEnsure it's plain English: Yes, using simple terms.\n\nI think this covers all requirements. Let me finalize.\n\nFinal prompt: \"Perform a structured audit of a healthcare provider's data privacy framework to identify risks and compliance issues, propose revisions, and deliver both technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nWord count: 23 words. Meets all criteria."
