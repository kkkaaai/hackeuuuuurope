The key elements are gathering multi-source info, synthesizing insights, handling uncertainty, and producing a structured deliverable. Need to keep it under 45 words.\n\nFirst, I should ensure the prompt includes all specified components. \"Synthesizing insights\" means combining data from different sources. \"Handling uncertainty\" might involve assumptions or risk factors. The deliverable needs structure, so maybe mentioning a report or presentation.\n\nWait, the user emphasized multiple sources and uncertainty. So phrases like \"comprehensive analysis\" and \"addressing key risks\" could cover those. Also, \"structured recommendation report\" fits the deliverable part. Let me check the word count—concise but thorough.\n\nAvoid jargon, keep it plain English. Maybe start with the action: \"Produce a...\" but the user said \"prompt describing a task,\" so phrasing it as an instruction works. Combine all elements smoothly without overcomplicating. Yeah, that should cover it."
