          "reasoning_content": "First, I need to generate a single-sentence plain-English prompt. The prompt should describe a multi-case customer support automation workflow for a telecom operator. The workflow involves four elements: triage, automatic resolution of simple issues, escalation of complex cases, and performance tracking.\n\nKey requirements:\n- Single sentence.\n- Plain English.\n- Under 40 words.\n- Include all four elements: triage, automatic resolution, escalation, and performance tracking.\n- Output only the prompt text.\n\nI need to condense this into a concise sentence. Let me list the components:\n1. Triage: Sorting or categorizing customer issues.\n2. Automatic resolution: Handling simple issues automatically.\n3. Escalation: Sending complex cases to human agents.\n4. Performance tracking: Monitoring the workflow's effectiveness.\n\nI should phrase this in a way that flows naturally in one sentence. For example: \"Create a customer support automation workflow that triages issues, resolves simple ones automatically, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance.\"\n\nNow, check the word count: \"Create a customer support automation workflow that triages issues, resolves simple ones automatically, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance.\" Let's count: Create (1), a (2), customer (3), support (4), automation (5), workflow (6), that (7), triages (8), issues (9), resolves (10), simple (11), ones (12), automatically (13), escalates (14), complex (15), cases (16), and (17), tracks (18), performance (19). That's 19 words, under 40.\n\nBut I need to specify it's for a telecom operator. So, I should include \"for a telecom operator\" in the sentence. Adjust: \"Design a telecom customer support automation workflow that triages issues, auto-resolves simple ones, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance.\"\n\nWord count: Design (1), a (2), telecom (3), customer (4), support (5), automation (6), workflow (7), that (8), triages (9), issues (10), auto-resolves (11), simple (12), ones (13), escalates (14), complex (15), cases (16), and (17), tracks (18), performance (19). Still 19 words.\n\nTo make it more precise, I can use \"multi-case\" as mentioned in the query. But \"multi-case\" might be redundant if I'm describing the workflow elements. The query says \"multi-case customer support automation workflow,\" so I should incorporate that. However, to save words, I can imply it by mentioning the different cases.\n\nAlternatively: \"Develop a multi-case automation workflow for telecom support that triages, auto-resolves simple issues, escalates complex ones, and tracks performance.\"\n\nWord count: Develop (1), a (2), multi-case (3), automation (4), workflow (5), for (6), telecom (7), support (8), that (9), triages (10), auto-resolves (11), simple (12), issues (13), escalates (14), complex (15), ones (16), and (17), tracks (18), performance (19). 19 words.\n\nI think this covers all elements. Let me ensure it's a single sentence and under 40 words. Yes, it is.\n\nFinal prompt: \"Develop a telecom customer support automation workflow that triages issues, auto-resolves simple ones, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance.\"\n\nI'll go with this."
