It needs to involve multiple tools, constraint resolution, system updates, and a final outcome.\n\nManufacturing often involves quality checks, production adjustments, and inventory updates. A scenario where a defect is found could tie these elements together naturally. \n\nThe prompt should mention specific tools like inspection software and ERP systems to show coordination. Resolving a constraint like adjusting machine settings adds complexity. Updating inventory and scheduling a rework order ensures a clear outcome.\n\nKeeping it under 40 words means trimming unnecessary details while hitting all the required elements."
