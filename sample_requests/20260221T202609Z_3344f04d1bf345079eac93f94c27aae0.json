          "reasoning_content": "First, I need to generate a single-sentence prompt in plain English. The prompt should describe a multi-case customer support automation workflow for a telecom operator. The workflow involves four elements: triage, automatic resolution of simple issues, escalation of complex cases, and performance tracking.\n\nKey requirements:\n- Single sentence.\n- Plain English.\n- Under 40 words.\n- Output only the prompt text.\n\nI need to condense all these elements into one concise sentence. Let me list the components:\n1. Triage: Sorting or categorizing customer issues.\n2. Automatic resolution of simple issues: Handling easy problems automatically.\n3. Escalation of complex cases: Sending harder issues to human agents.\n4. Performance tracking: Monitoring how well the system works.\n\nI should phrase this as a prompt that someone might use to instruct an AI or a system to create such a workflow. But the instruction is to \"generate one single-sentence plain-English prompt describing...\" so the prompt itself should describe the workflow.\n\nThe user says: \"output only the prompt text\" so I need to write the prompt directly.\n\nLet me draft a sentence that includes all elements:\n\n\"Create a customer support automation workflow that triages issues, automatically resolves simple ones, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance for a telecom operator.\"\n\nNow, check the word count: \"Create a customer support automation workflow that triages issues, automatically resolves simple ones, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance for a telecom operator.\" – Let's count: Create (1), a (2), customer (3), support (4), automation (5), workflow (6), that (7), triages (8), issues (9), automatically (10), resolves (11), simple (12), ones (13), escalates (14), complex (15), cases (16), and (17), tracks (18), performance (19), for (20), a (21), telecom (22), operator (23). So 23 words, which is under 40. Good.\n\nIs this descriptive enough? It covers all the points. I should ensure it's a single sentence and in plain English. Yes, it is.\n\nI could make it more concise, but this seems fine. Another version: \"Design an automated telecom support workflow that triages, auto-resolves simple issues, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance.\" That's shorter: Design (1), an (2), automated (3), telecom (4), support (5), workflow (6), that (7), triages (8), auto-resolves (9), simple (10), issues (11), escalates (12), complex (13), cases (14), and (15), tracks (16), performance (17). 17 words.\n\nBut \"auto-resolves\" might not be as plain English as \"automatically resolves.\" I'll stick with the first version for clarity.\n\nThe user said \"plain-English prompt,\" so I should use simple language. The first version uses \"automatically resolves,\" which is clear.\n\nFinally, output only the prompt text, so I don't need any additional explanation.\n\nI'll go with the first draft: \"Create a customer support automation workflow that triages issues, automatically resolves simple ones, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance for a telecom operator.\"\n\nBut let's confirm it's under 40 words. Yes, 23 words.\n\nI think this meets all requirements."
