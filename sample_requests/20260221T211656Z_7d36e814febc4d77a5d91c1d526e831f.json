Let me start by breaking down the original query.\n\nFirst, the user asked for a single-sentence prompt under 45 words that describes a complex AI fairness task. The key requirements are: gathering multiple sources, synthesizing insights, handling uncertainty, and producing a structured deliverable. \n\nHmm, I need to ensure the prompt is concise but covers all those elements. The example provided mentions comparing methods, analyzing real-world applicability, assessing limitations, and recommending action steps. That hits each requirement: comparison (multiple sources), applicability and limitations (synthesizing insights, uncertainty), and recommendations (structured deliverable).\n\nWait, did I miss anything? The word count is 40, which is under 45. The sentence structure flows logically, starting with the task, then the analysis steps, and ending with the deliverable. It avoids jargon, keeping it plain English. Yes, that should cover it."
