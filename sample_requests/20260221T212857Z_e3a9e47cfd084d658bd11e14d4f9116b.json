Let me break down the requirements.\n\nFirst, it needs to include research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals. All in under 45 words. \n\nHmm, how do I fit all those elements into one smooth sentence? Maybe start with the research phase, then mention the content types, ensure channel consistency, and end with the goals.\n\nWait, the user specified \"end-to-end\" so the prompt should cover the whole process. Let me try combining the key points without making it clunky. \n\nAvoid jargon, keep it plain English. Focus on the manufacturing space—maybe mention \"B2B\" or \"industrial\" to specify the audience. Need to make sure each required component is touched on briefly. \n\nLet me draft a version: \"Research, create, and distribute multi-format content across channels with consistent messaging for a manufacturing client, aiming to achieve specific lead generation and engagement metrics.\" That’s 22 words, hits all the points. \n\nDoes it flow naturally? Yes. Under 45 words? Check. Okay, that should work."
