It needs to describe a high-stakes task in pharmaceutical clinical trials involving structured analysis, risk identification, compliance issues, proposing revisions, and delivering both technical and executive summaries. The prompt must be under 45 words.\n\nFirst, I should focus on the core elements: clinical trials, analysis, risks, compliance, revisions, and summaries. Maybe start with the action, like \"Analyze a clinical trial protocol.\" Then include the key tasks: identifying risks and compliance gaps. Next, mention proposing amendments. Finally, add the deliverables: technical and executive summaries.\n\nWait, the user specified \"high-stakes,\" so I need to emphasize urgency or importance. Words like \"urgent\" or \"critical\" could work. Also, keep it concise. Let me count the words in my draft: \"Analyze an urgent clinical trial protocol to identify risks and compliance gaps, propose amendments, and deliver both technical and executive summaries.\" That's 20 words. Under 45, so it fits. Check if it covers all points: structured analysis (analyze protocol), risks/compliance (identify gaps), revisions (propose amendments), summaries (technical and executive). Yes, it does. Should I make it more specific? The user mentioned pharmaceutical, so maybe specify \"pharmaceutical clinical trial.\" But the user already mentioned that in the query, so including \"clinical trial\" might be enough. Keep it as is."
