They mentioned it needs to include research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals. Also, under 45 words.\n\nHmm, starting with the core elements. Research should come first since it's foundational. Then multi-format creation—maybe list examples like videos and infographics. Consistency across platforms is key, so mention aligning tone and style. Finally, measurable goals to track performance.\n\nWait, the user specified \"end-to-end,\" so the prompt should cover from start to finish. Let me check the word count. \"Research, plan, and produce a multi-format content series\" covers the initial steps. Adding \"including videos, blogs, and infographics\" specifies formats. \"Maintain consistent messaging across all platforms\" ensures channel alignment. Ending with \"to achieve specific engagement and conversion targets\" ties in measurable goals.\n\nThat’s 40 words. Yeah, fits under 45 and hits all the points. No markdown, just plain text. Looks good."
