The workflow needs to include triage, auto-resolution for simple issues, escalation for complex cases, and performance tracking. \n\nI can structure it as a clear instruction for an AI or system designer. Starting with the main action (\"Create an automated workflow...\"), then listing the key components in a logical sequence: triage first, then auto-resolution and escalation as parallel paths, ending with performance tracking. \n\nNeed to keep it under 40 words while covering all required elements. The current draft hits 32 words - \"Create an automated workflow that triages hosting tickets, solves common issues automatically, escalates complex cases to human agents, and tracks resolution performance.\" That covers all four components in a natural flow."
