          "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants a single-sentence prompt in plain English. It should describe a multi-case customer support automation workflow for a managed hosting provider. The workflow includes triage, automatic resolution of simple issues, escalation of complex cases, and performance tracking.\n\nKey elements to include:\n- Triage: Sorting or categorizing issues.\n- Automatic resolution: Solving simple issues automatically.\n- Escalation: Sending complex cases to human agents or higher levels.\n- Performance tracking: Monitoring and measuring how well the workflow is performing.\n\nThe prompt must be under 40 words. I need to ensure it's concise and covers all these points in one sentence.\n\nStructure the sentence: Start with the purpose or context, then list the components. For example: \"Design a customer support automation workflow that handles triage, auto-resolves simple issues, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance.\"\n\nCheck the word count: \"Design a customer support automation workflow that handles triage, auto-resolves simple issues, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance.\" – Let's count: Design (1), a (2), customer (3), support (4), automation (5), workflow (6), that (7), handles (8), triage (9), auto-resolves (10), simple (11), issues (12), escalates (13), complex (14), cases (15), and (16), tracks (17), performance (18). That's 18 words. Under 40, so good.\n\nBut I need to specify it's for a managed hosting provider. So, incorporate that: \"For a managed hosting provider, design a support automation workflow that triages issues, auto-resolves simple ones, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance.\"\n\nWord count: For (1), a (2), managed (3), hosting (4), provider (5), design (6), a (7), support (8), automation (9), workflow (10), that (11), triages (12), issues (13), auto-resolves (14), simple (15), ones (16), escalates (17), complex (18), cases (19), and (20), tracks (21), performance (22). 22 words. Still under 40.\n\nMake it more natural: \"Create a customer support automation system for a managed hosting provider that performs triage, automatically resolves simple issues, escalates complex cases, and includes performance tracking.\"\n\nWord count: Create (1), a (2), customer (3), support (4), automation (5), system (6), for (7), a (8), managed (9), hosting (10), provider (11), that (12), performs (13), triage (14), automatically (15), resolves (16), simple (17), issues (18), escalates (19), complex (20), cases (21), and (22), includes (23), performance (24), tracking (25). 25 words.\n\nThis seems clear and covers all points. I'll go with this version.\n\nFinal check: Is it a single sentence? Yes. Plain English? Yes. Under 40 words? Yes."
