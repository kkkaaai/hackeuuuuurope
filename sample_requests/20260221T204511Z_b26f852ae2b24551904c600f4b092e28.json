          "reasoning_content": "First, the prompt needs to be a single sentence in plain English. It should describe a realistic end-to-end operational workflow in the fintech domain.\n\nKey elements from the instruction:\n- Coordinate multiple tools.\n- Resolve at least one constraint.\n- Update systems.\n- Deliver a final outcome.\n\nAlso, output only the prompt text, and keep it under 40 words.\n\nI need to brainstorm a fintech scenario. Fintech covers areas like banking, payments, lending, investments, etc. An operational workflow could involve things like loan processing, fraud detection, payment settlements, or compliance checks.\n\nLet's think of an example: A customer applies for a loan. The workflow might involve checking credit scores (using a tool), verifying income (another tool), resolving constraints like insufficient documentation, updating the loan management system, and finally approving or rejecting the loan.\n\nBut I need to ensure it's end-to-end, meaning from start to finish.\n\nAnother idea: Processing a large international payment. This could involve currency conversion tools, compliance checks, resolving constraints like transaction limits, updating account systems, and confirming the payment.\n\nNow, I have to craft a single sentence that encapsulates all this. Keep it concise and under 40 words.\n\nLet me draft a few options:\n\n1. \"When a customer requests a large international wire transfer, the system must verify funds, check compliance, convert currency, resolve daily limit constraints, update both bank accounts, and confirm the transaction.\"\n\n   Word count: 22 words. It includes multiple tools (verification, compliance, currency conversion), resolves a constraint (daily limit), updates systems (bank accounts), and delivers an outcome (confirm transaction). This seems good.\n\n2. \"Processing a loan application involves pulling credit reports, assessing risk, resolving income verification issues, updating the loan origination system, and issuing a decision.\"\n\n   Word count: 18 words. It coordinates tools (credit report pull, risk assessment), resolves a constraint (income verification issues), updates systems (loan origination system), and delivers an outcome (issuing a decision). Also realistic.\n\nI need to ensure it's end-to-end operational workflow. Both examples seem fine.\n\nBut let's check the word count for the first one: 22 words. Under 40, so okay.\n\nThe instruction says \"output only the prompt text,\" so I should not add any extra explanation.\n\nI'll choose one that clearly includes all elements.\n\nFinal prompt: \"Process a customer's loan application by checking credit, verifying income, resolving documentation gaps, updating the lending platform, and providing approval or denial.\"\n\nWord count: 16 words. Yes, this includes multiple tools (credit check, income verification), resolves a constraint (documentation gaps), updates systems (lending platform), and delivers an outcome (approval or denial).\n\nI think this works. Let me confirm it's under 40 words: 16 words, so fine.\n\nI'll go with this."
