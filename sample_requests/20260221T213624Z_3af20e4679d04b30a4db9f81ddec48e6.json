          "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants a single-sentence prompt in plain English. It should describe a multi-case customer support automation workflow for a SaaS startup. The workflow involves: triage, automatic resolution of simple issues, escalation of complex cases, and performance tracking.\n\nKey elements to include:\n- Triage: Sorting or categorizing incoming support requests.\n- Automatic resolution: Using automation to fix simple issues without human intervention.\n- Escalation: Sending complex cases to human agents or higher support levels.\n- Performance tracking: Monitoring and analyzing the workflow's effectiveness.\n\nThe prompt must be under 40 words. I need to ensure it's concise and covers all these aspects in one sentence.\n\nStructure the sentence: Start with the purpose or context, then list the components. For example: \"Design a customer support automation workflow that triages tickets, resolves simple issues automatically, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance metrics.\"\n\nNow, check the word count: \"Design a customer support automation workflow that triages tickets, resolves simple issues automatically, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance metrics.\" Let's count: Design (1), a (2), customer (3), support (4), automation (5), workflow (6), that (7), triages (8), tickets (9), resolves (10), simple (11), issues (12), automatically (13), escalates (14), complex (15), cases (16), and (17), tracks (18), performance (19), metrics (20). So 20 words, which is under 40. Good.\n\nBut I should make sure it's specifically for a SaaS startup. Maybe include that context. However, the user said \"for a SaaS startup,\" so I can imply that in the workflow description. The prompt itself is about generating the workflow, so it should be clear.\n\nRefine the sentence to be more natural and cover all points. Ensure it's a single sentence.\n\nFinal prompt: \"Create a customer support automation system for a SaaS startup that triages inquiries, auto-resolves common problems, escalates tough cases, and monitors performance analytics.\"\n\nCount words: Create (1), a (2), customer (3), support (4), automation (5), system (6), for (7), a (8), SaaS (9), startup (10), that (11), triages (12), inquiries (13), auto-resolves (14), common (15), problems (16), escalates (17), tough (18), cases (19), and (20), monitors (21), performance (22), analytics (23). 23 words, still under 40.\n\nI used \"auto-resolves\" to mean automatic resolution, and \"tough cases\" for complex cases. \"Monitors performance analytics\" covers performance tracking. This seems comprehensive.\n\nTo make it even more precise: \"Design an automated support workflow that triages tickets, resolves simple issues instantly, escalates complex ones, and tracks key metrics for a SaaS company.\"\n\nWord count: Design (1), an (2), automated (3), support (4), workflow (5), that (6), triages (7), tickets (8), resolves (9), simple (10), issues (11), instantly (12), escalates (13), complex (14), ones (15), and (16), tracks (17), key (18), metrics (19), for (20), a (21), SaaS (22), company (23). 23 words.\n\nBoth versions are fine. I'll go with the first one I thought of, but ensure it's under 40 words.\n\nThe user said \"output only the prompt text,\" so I shouldn't include any extra explanation. Just the prompt.\n\nFinal decision: Use a concise sentence that includes all elements."
