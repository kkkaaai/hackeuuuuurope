They need it to cover structured analysis, risk/compliance identification, revisions, and both technical and executive summaries. \n\nAircraft maintenance is critical, so the prompt should emphasize safety and compliance. The response must be a single sentence in plain English. \n\nI can focus on a scenario like revising maintenance protocols after an incident. That naturally requires analysis, risk assessment, and summaries for different audiences. Keeping it under 45 words means trimming unnecessary details while hitting all the required elements. \n\nThe current draft seems to fit: it sets the context (incident review), specifies the actions (analyze, identify, propose), and calls for both technical and executive outputs. It’s also within the word limit."
