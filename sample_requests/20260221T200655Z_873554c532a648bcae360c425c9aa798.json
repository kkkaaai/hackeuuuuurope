The requirements are specific: end-to-end, involving research, multi-format creation, channel consistency, and measurable goals. Need to keep it under 45 words.\n\nOkay, the prompt should cover all those elements without being too wordy. Let me start by listing the key components: research, multi-format content, consistency across channels, measurable goals, and fintech context. \n\nMaybe structure it as a directive: \"Develop a fintech campaign that includes research, creates blog and video content, maintains brand voice everywhere, and tracks engagement metrics.\" That hits all the points. \n\nWait, \"blog and video\" might be too limiting for \"multi-format.\" Could say \"varied content formats\" instead. And \"tracks engagement metrics\" covers measurable goals. Let me check the word count... yes, under 45. \n\nThe fintech space is already mentioned, so no need to over-explain. Just keep it clean and actionable."
