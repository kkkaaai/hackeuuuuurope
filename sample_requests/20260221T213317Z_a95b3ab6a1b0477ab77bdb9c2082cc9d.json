          "reasoning_content": "First, the prompt must be in a single sentence. It should be in plain English, meaning clear and straightforward language without jargon.\n\nThe prompt needs to describe a realistic end-to-end operational workflow in the manufacturing domain. So, it should involve steps from start to finish in a manufacturing context.\n\nKey elements: coordinating multiple tools, resolving at least one constraint, updating systems, and delivering a final outcome. I need to incorporate all these into one sentence.\n\nKeep it under 40 words. I need to count the words to ensure compliance.\n\nLet me brainstorm a realistic scenario. For example, in manufacturing, a common workflow might involve production scheduling, quality checks, inventory management, etc. Coordinating tools could mean using software for planning, machinery for production, and systems for tracking. Resolving a constraint might be addressing a material shortage or machine downtime. Updating systems could involve logging data or adjusting schedules. Delivering a final outcome might be a finished product ready for shipment.\n\nNow, I need to condense this into one sentence under 40 words.\n\nPossible prompt: \"From order receipt to shipment, coordinate production schedules, resolve material shortages, update inventory systems, and ensure quality checks to deliver finished products.\"\n\nLet's check the elements:\n- Coordinating multiple tools: production schedules, inventory systems, quality checks – these are tools or systems.\n- Resolving at least one constraint: material shortages.\n- Updating systems: inventory systems.\n- Delivering a final outcome: finished products.\n\nBut is this end-to-end? It covers order receipt to shipment, so yes.\n\nWord count: \"From order receipt to shipment, coordinate production schedules, resolve material shortages, update inventory systems, and ensure quality checks to deliver finished products.\" That's 20 words. Under 40, good.\n\nI can make it more specific. Perhaps mention tools explicitly. But \"production schedules\" and \"inventory systems\" are tools in a broad sense. The prompt says \"coordinating multiple tools,\" which could include software and hardware.\n\nAnother example: \"Manage the assembly line by coordinating robots, resolving calibration errors, updating the maintenance log, and producing compliant components.\"\n\nLet's see:\n- Coordinating multiple tools: robots.\n- Resolving constraint: calibration errors.\n- Updating systems: maintenance log.\n- Delivering final outcome: compliant components.\n\nWord count: 13 words. Also good.\n\nBut is it end-to-end operational workflow? \"Manage the assembly line\" might not cover from start to finish. \"Producing compliant components\" is an outcome, but maybe not fully end-to-end.\n\nI should ensure it's a workflow that spans from initiation to completion.\n\nRefine the first one: \"Handle customer orders by planning production, resolving machine downtime, updating ERP systems, and shipping finished goods.\"\n\nWord count: 14 words. Elements:\n- Coordinating tools: planning production (which involves tools), ERP systems.\n- Resolving constraint: machine downtime.\n- Updating systems: ERP systems.\n- Delivering outcome: shipping finished goods.\n\nThis seems comprehensive.\n\nTo make it more manufacturing-specific, I can add details. But keep it under 40 words.\n\nFinal prompt: \"Coordinate material procurement, production scheduling, and quality control to resolve supply chain delays, update inventory databases, and deliver manufactured goods to customers.\"\n\nWord count: 18 words. Elements:\n- Coordinating multiple tools: material procurement, production scheduling, quality control – these involve tools and systems.\n- Resolving constraint: supply chain delays.\n- Updating systems: inventory databases.\n- Delivering final outcome: manufactured goods to customers.\n\nThis is a single sentence and under 40 words. It describes an end-to-end workflow from procurement to delivery.\n\nI think this works."
