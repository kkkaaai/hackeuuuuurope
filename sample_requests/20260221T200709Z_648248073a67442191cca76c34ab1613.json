Let me break down the requirements.\n\nFirst, the prompt needs to be in plain English, under 45 words, and only the text. It should involve multiple sources, synthesizing insights, handling uncertainty, and a structured deliverable. \n\nHmm, climate adaptation is broad. Maybe focus on a specific area like urban planning or agriculture. Synthesis and uncertainty are key—perhaps include terms like \"assess risks\" and \"compare strategies.\" \n\nWait, structured deliverable means the output should be actionable, like a report or policy brief. Need to combine all elements concisely. How about starting with \"Produce a comparative report...\"? That covers the deliverable. \n\nMultiple sources could be scientific data and community input. Synthesis might involve merging these insights. Uncertainty handling could be through risk assessment. Let me check the word count... Keep it tight. \n\nYes, something like: \"Produce a comparative report that assesses climate adaptation risks and strategies by synthesizing scientific data with local community insights.\" That’s 18 words. Covers sources, synthesis, uncertainty, and deliverable."
