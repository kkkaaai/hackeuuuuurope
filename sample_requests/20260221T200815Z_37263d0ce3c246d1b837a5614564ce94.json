They asked for a single-sentence prompt under 40 words that covers operational optimization for an autonomous delivery fleet. The key elements are analyzing live data, adjusting parameters safely, monitoring results, and reporting improvements.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure all these components are included concisely. \"Analyze live fleet data\" captures the data analysis part. \"Safely optimize routes and speeds\" addresses parameter adjustment within safety constraints. \"Track outcomes\" covers monitoring results, and \"report efficiency gains\" handles the performance reporting. \n\nChecking the word count, the prompt is exactly 13 words, well under the limit. It flows naturally as a single instruction without being too technical. The phrasing uses active verbs like analyze, optimize, track, and report to make it actionable. Safety is emphasized by including \"safely,\" which meets the constraint requirement. The focus on efficiency gains ties back to the goal of performance improvement."
