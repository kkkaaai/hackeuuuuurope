Need to cover live data analysis, parameter adjustment within safety limits, result monitoring, and performance reporting.\n\nThe core elements are all operational: real-time analysis, safe tweaking, tracking outcomes, quantifying gains. Can combine them into a fluid instruction without exceeding word limit.\n\nHow about structuring it as a direct command to the system? Start with the action, weave in constraints, end with measurable outcome. Yes, that flows naturally.\n\nWord count check: current draft is exactly 40 words. All requirements met - live data, safety boundaries, monitoring, improvement metrics. Final version fits."
