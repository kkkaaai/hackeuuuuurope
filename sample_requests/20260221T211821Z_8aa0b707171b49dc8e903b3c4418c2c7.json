Let me break down their requirements.\n\nThey mentioned a managed hosting provider, so the workflow should include triage, automatic resolution for simple issues, escalation for complex cases, and performance tracking. \n\nI need to make sure all these elements fit into one concise sentence. Let me start with the triage part, then mention auto-fix for simple problems, followed by escalating harder issues, and end with tracking metrics. \n\nCounting the words... \"Design a support workflow that first triages tickets, auto-fixes simple issues, escalates complex cases, and tracks resolution metrics\" – that’s 18 words. It covers all the points and stays under the limit."
