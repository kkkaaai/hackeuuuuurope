It needs to cover multi-source research, synthesis, uncertainty handling, and a structured output. \n\nClimate adaptation is broad, so focusing on a specific high-stakes context like coastal cities makes it tangible. \"Gather and compare\" covers multi-source research, \"assess and synthesize\" addresses analysis and uncertainty, and \"produce a prioritized action plan\" ensures a structured deliverable. \n\nThe sentence fits the word limit and hits all required elements without extra fluff."
