They specified it needs to be a realistic end-to-end operational workflow, involve multiple tools, resolve at least one constraint, update systems, and deliver a final outcome. Also, keep it under 40 words and output only the prompt.\n\nHmm, fintech domain... maybe something about loan approval or fraud detection? Loan approval comes to mind because it usually involves checking credit scores, verifying documents, and updating accounts. Need to mention tools like credit check, AML screening, and account systems. Also, include a constraint like insufficient funds or flagged transaction. \n\nWait, the example prompt already covers credit application, multiple tools (APIs, screening), resolving a flagged transaction, updating loan and customer systems, and disbursing funds. That ticks all the boxes. Yeah, that should work. Let me make sure it's under 40 words. Count the words... yep, it fits. Just output the prompt as is."
