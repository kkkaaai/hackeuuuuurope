The user asked for a single-sentence prompt under 45 words that includes research, multi-format content creation, consistency across channels, and measurable goals in manufacturing.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure all the specified elements are covered. Research is essential, so including terms like \"research and develop\" addresses that. Multi-format content means mentioning different types like articles and case studies. Consistency across channels implies a unified message, so \"single campaign message\" fits. Measurable goals can be tied to lead generation.\n\nNext, keeping it concise under 45 words. The sentence structure should flow naturally while hitting each point. Avoiding jargon to keep it plain-English. Checking word count to ensure it’s within limit. Making sure the manufacturing context is clear without being too specific. Finally, ensuring the prompt is actionable and clear for an end-to-end campaign."
