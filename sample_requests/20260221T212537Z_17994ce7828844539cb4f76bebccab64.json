Need to include triage, auto-resolution for simple issues, escalation for complex cases, and performance tracking. \n\nThe core challenge is packing all required components into a tight sentence without exceeding the word limit. Retail context must be clear upfront. \n\nUsing \"customer inquiries\" covers both calls and messages. \"Route and resolve automatically\" implies triage and simple case handling. \"Escalate complex cases\" checks that box. \"Track performance\" satisfies the last requirement. \n\nCounting the words: 20 total, well under the limit. The structure flows logically from intake to resolution to metrics."
