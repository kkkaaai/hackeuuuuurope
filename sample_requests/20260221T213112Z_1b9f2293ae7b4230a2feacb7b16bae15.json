Let me break down the requirements.\n\nFirst, it needs to be realistic and include defining requirements, building components, testing, fixing issues, and deploying. Edge computing is the focus, so maybe something with IoT or real-time processing.\n\nThe sentence has to be under 45 words. Let me list all the elements: requirements, building, testing, debugging, deployment. How to fit them all concisely? \n\nMaybe start with the goal: develop an edge application. Include requirement gathering, component creation, testing, debugging, and deployment to production. Need to make it flow naturally without being wordy.\n\nCheck the word count. \"Design, develop, test, debug, and deploy\" covers all steps. Specify edge environment and a concrete task like processing sensor data. Add a constraint like low latency to make it realistic. \n\nEnsure it’s a single sentence and under the limit. Yeah, that should cover everything the user asked for."
