          "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants a single-sentence plain-English prompt. That means I need to create one sentence that is clear and in everyday language.\n\nThe prompt should describe a high-stakes professional task in health data privacy. So, the context is healthcare data, specifically privacy, and it's high-stakes, meaning it has serious consequences.\n\nThe task requires structured analysis, identifying risks or compliance issues, proposing revisions, and delivering both technical and executive summaries. I need to incorporate all these elements into the prompt.\n\nI have to output only the prompt text, and it must be under 45 words. So, I need to count the words to ensure compliance.\n\nLet me draft a prompt that includes all these components:\n\n- High-stakes professional task in health data privacy\n\n- Structured analysis\n\n- Identifying risks or compliance issues\n\n- Proposing revisions\n\n- Delivering technical and executive summaries\n\nI need to phrase this as a single sentence. For example: \"Analyze our health data privacy framework to identify compliance gaps, propose corrective actions, and provide both technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nBut let's see if that covers all elements. It includes analysis, identifying compliance gaps (which are risks or compliance issues), proposing corrective actions (revisions), and providing summaries. However, it doesn't explicitly mention \"structured analysis\" or \"high-stakes.\" I can imply high-stakes by the context of health data privacy.\n\nTo make it more comprehensive: \"Conduct a structured analysis of our health data privacy practices to identify risks and compliance issues, propose revisions, and deliver both technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nNow, count the words: \"Conduct a structured analysis of our health data privacy practices to identify risks and compliance issues, propose revisions, and deliver both technical and executive summaries.\" That's 24 words. Under 45, so good.\n\nIs it high-stakes? Health data privacy is inherently high-stakes due to legal and ethical implications, so it should be implied.\n\nI should ensure it's a prompt, meaning it's instructing someone to do this task. So, it should be directive.\n\nFinal check: The user said \"prompt describing a high-stakes professional task,\" so the prompt itself should describe the task. Yes, my draft does that.\n\nI think this works. Let me write it cleanly."
