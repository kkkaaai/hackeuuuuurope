          "reasoning_content": "First, the prompt must be a single sentence in plain English. It should describe a realistic software engineering task in infrastructure as code (IaC). The task needs to include defining requirements, building components, testing, fixing issues, and deploying to an environment. Also, the output should be only the prompt text and under 45 words.\n\nI need to craft a sentence that incorporates all these elements concisely. Let me list the key components:\n- Defining requirements\n- Building components\n- Testing\n- Fixing issues\n- Deploying to an environment\n\nI'll start by brainstorming a sentence structure. For example: \"Create an IaC template that defines requirements, builds components, tests them, fixes any issues, and deploys to a staging environment.\"\n\nBut I need to ensure it's realistic and specific to infrastructure as code. IaC often involves tools like Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, etc. So, I should mention something like \"using Terraform\" to make it realistic.\n\nNow, let's count the words in my example: \"Create an IaC template that defines requirements, builds components, tests them, fixes any issues, and deploys to a staging environment.\" That's 20 words. Under 45 words, so that's fine. But is it realistic? It might be a bit vague.\n\nTo make it more realistic, I can specify the infrastructure component. For instance, \"Define requirements, build, test, fix issues, and deploy a scalable web server infrastructure using Terraform to AWS.\"\n\nBut I need to include all elements in one sentence. Let me refine: \"As a software engineer, you must define requirements, build components, test, fix issues, and deploy a Kubernetes cluster using Terraform to a production environment.\"\n\nThat's 22 words. Still under 45.\n\nI should ensure that it flows naturally. The prompt is for a task, so it might start with \"Design and implement...\" or something similar.\n\nFinal thought: The prompt should be clear and direct. Since it's for generating a task description, I'll go with something like:\n\n\"Develop an IaC solution by defining requirements, building network components, testing for security flaws, fixing vulnerabilities, and deploying to a cloud environment.\"\n\nLet's count: \"Develop an IaC solution by defining requirements, building network components, testing for security flaws, fixing vulnerabilities, and deploying to a cloud environment.\" That's 18 words.\n\nIt includes all elements: defining requirements, building components (network components), testing (for security flaws), fixing issues (vulnerabilities), and deploying (to a cloud environment). This seems realistic for IaC.\n\nI'll use this as the output. But let's make sure it's a single sentence. Yes, it is one sentence.\n\nNow, output only the prompt text. So, I'll write it directly."
