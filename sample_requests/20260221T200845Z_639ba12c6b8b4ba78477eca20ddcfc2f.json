          "reasoning_content": "First, the prompt must be a single sentence in plain English. It should describe a realistic end-to-end operational workflow in the fintech domain. The workflow needs to coordinate multiple tools, resolve at least one constraint, update systems, and deliver a final outcome. Also, the output should only be the prompt text and keep it under 40 words.\n\nI need to ensure the prompt is concise and within the word limit. Let me brainstorm a fintech scenario. Fintech involves financial technology, so workflows could include loan processing, fraud detection, payment processing, etc.\n\nKey elements:\n- Coordinating multiple tools: This could involve using software for data analysis, communication platforms, databases, etc.\n- Resolving at least one constraint: For example, a limit on transaction amount, regulatory compliance, or resource availability.\n- Updating systems: Such as updating customer records, transaction logs, or account balances.\n- Delivering a final outcome: Like approving a loan, completing a transaction, or generating a report.\n\nI'll draft a prompt that encapsulates all these aspects in one sentence.\n\nExample: \"Process a customer's loan application by verifying income with multiple data sources, overcoming credit score thresholds, updating the loan management system, and issuing funds upon approval.\"\n\nLet's check the word count: \"Process a customer's loan application by verifying income with multiple data sources, overcoming credit score thresholds, updating the loan management system, and issuing funds upon approval.\" That's 24 words. Good.\n\nIs it realistic? Yes, loan processing in fintech often involves coordinating tools for credit checks, income verification, etc. Constraint: credit score thresholds need to be resolved. Updating systems: loan management system. Final outcome: issuing funds.\n\nBut I need to ensure it's end-to-end operational workflow. This seems to cover from application to disbursement.\n\nAnother example: \"Automate fraud detection by analyzing transactions across platforms, resolving false positives with manual review, updating risk databases, and blocking fraudulent accounts.\"\n\nWord count: \"Automate fraud detection by analyzing transactions across platforms, resolving false positives with manual review, updating risk databases, and blocking fraudulent accounts.\" That's 20 words.\n\nBoth seem okay. I'll choose one that best fits all criteria.\n\nI need to output only the prompt text. So, I'll write the prompt directly.\n\nFinal decision: I'll go with the first one about loan application because it's a common fintech workflow.\n\nRefine the prompt: \"Coordinate tools to process a loan application, resolve credit constraints, update banking systems, and disburse funds to the customer.\"\n\nWord count: 16 words. It includes coordinating tools, resolving constraints (credit constraints), updating systems (banking systems), and delivering outcome (disburse funds). It's under 40 words and is a single sentence.\n\nBut is it end-to-end? It mentions process, resolve, update, disburse, so yes.\n\nI think this works."
