          "reasoning_content": "First, the task is to generate a single-sentence prompt in plain English. It should describe an operational optimization task for a wind-turbine farm. The prompt must include analyzing live data, adjusting parameters within safety constraints, monitoring results, and reporting performance improvements.\n\nKey elements to cover:\n- Analyzing live data\n- Adjusting parameters within safety constraints\n- Monitoring results\n- Reporting performance improvements\n\nI need to combine these into one sentence that is under 40 words. Let me try drafting a sentence.\n\nDraft 1: \"Analyze live turbine data, adjust operational parameters safely, monitor the outcomes, and report any performance improvements.\"\n\nWord count: 13 words. That covers all elements, but I need to make it sound like a prompt for an optimization task.\n\nDraft 2: \"Optimize wind-farm operations by analyzing live data, adjusting parameters within safety limits, monitoring results, and reporting performance gains.\"\n\nWord count: 16 words. This is better because it starts with \"Optimize wind-farm operations,\" which sets the context.\n\nI should ensure it's under 40 words, which it is. Now, check if it's a single sentence and in plain English. Yes, it's a single sentence and straightforward.\n\nLet me verify the word count: Optimize (1), wind-farm (2), operations (3), by (4), analyzing (5), live (6), data (7), adjusting (8), parameters (9), within (10), safety (11), limits (12), monitoring (13), results (14), and (15), reporting (16), performance (17), gains (18). 18 words, so well under 40.\n\nI need to include \"wind-turbine farm\" as per the query. I used \"wind-farm,\" but \"wind-turbine farm\" might be more precise. However, \"wind farm\" is commonly used. To be precise, I'll use \"wind-turbine farm.\"\n\nRevised draft: \"Optimize wind-turbine farm operations by analyzing live data, adjusting parameters within safety constraints, monitoring results, and reporting performance improvements.\"\n\nWord count: 18 words. \"Constraints\" is used instead of \"limits\" to match the query.\n\nThis seems to cover all requirements. Let me ensure it's a prompt: It starts with \"Optimize,\" which is an imperative verb, so it's like an instruction or prompt.\n\nThe query says \"output only the prompt text,\" so I should just provide the sentence without any additional explanation.\n\nFinal prompt: \"Optimize wind-turbine farm operations by analyzing live data, adjusting parameters within safety constraints, monitoring results, and reporting performance improvements.\""
