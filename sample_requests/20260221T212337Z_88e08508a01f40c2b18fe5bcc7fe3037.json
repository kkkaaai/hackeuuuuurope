          "reasoning_content": "First, the user wants a single-sentence plain-English prompt. That means it should be one sentence, in simple English, no technical jargon.\n\nThe prompt should describe a multi-case customer support automation workflow for a retail chain. Key elements include:\n- Triage\n- Automatic resolution of simple issues\n- Escalation of complex cases\n- Performance tracking\n\nThe output should be only the prompt text, and under 40 words. I need to count the words to ensure it's within the limit.\n\nI need to combine all these elements into a concise sentence. Let me brainstorm a draft:\n\n\"Create a customer support workflow that triages inquiries, automatically resolves simple issues, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance metrics for a retail chain.\"\n\nNow, check the word count: \"Create a customer support workflow that triages inquiries, automatically resolves simple issues, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance metrics for a retail chain.\" Let's count: Create (1), a (2), customer (3), support (4), workflow (5), that (6), triages (7), inquiries (8), automatically (9), resolves (10), simple (11), issues (12), escalates (13), complex (14), cases (15), and (16), tracks (17), performance (18), metrics (19), for (20), a (21), retail (22), chain (23). So 23 words. Under 40, good.\n\nBut is it a prompt? The user said \"prompt,\" so it should be something that instructs or describes what to do. In this context, it might be a prompt for designing such a workflow. The user said \"Generate one single-sentence plain-English prompt,\" so I'm generating a prompt that someone might use to request this workflow.\n\nThe sentence should be imperative or descriptive. Since it's a prompt, it could start with \"Design\" or \"Create.\" My draft uses \"Create,\" which seems fine.\n\nLet me ensure it covers all elements: triage, automatic resolution, escalation, performance tracking. Yes, all are included.\n\nI should make it more streamlined. Perhaps: \"Design an automated customer support system for retail that triages cases, auto-resolves simple ones, escalates complex ones, and tracks performance.\"\n\nWord count: Design (1), an (2), automated (3), customer (4), support (5), system (6), for (7), retail (8), that (9), triages (10), cases (11), auto-resolves (12), simple (13), ones (14), escalates (15), complex (16), ones (17), and (18), tracks (19), performance (20). 20 words.\n\nI used \"retail\" instead of \"retail chain,\" but that might be implied. To be precise, I'll include \"retail chain.\" But in the interest of brevity, \"retail\" might suffice.\n\nThe user said \"for a retail chain,\" so I should include that. In my first draft, I had \"for a retail chain,\" which is fine.\n\nLet's finalize: \"Create a customer support automation workflow for a retail chain that triages issues, auto-resolves simple ones, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance.\"\n\nWord count: Create (1), a (2), customer (3), support (4), automation (5), workflow (6), for (7), a (8), retail (9), chain (10), that (11), triages (12), issues (13), auto-resolves (14), simple (15), ones (16), escalates (17), complex (18), cases (19), and (20), tracks (21), performance (22). 22 words.\n\nI think this works. I'll go with this."
