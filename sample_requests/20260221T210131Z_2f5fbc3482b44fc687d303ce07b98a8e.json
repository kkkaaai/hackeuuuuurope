They mentioned including live data analysis, parameter adjustment within safety constraints, monitoring results, and reporting performance improvements. Plus, it needs to be under 40 words in plain English.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure all key elements are covered. Live data analysis can be phrased as \"using live data.\" Adjusting parameters safely is crucial—maybe \"adjust routing and load parameters safely.\" Monitoring and reporting should tie back to performance improvements. \n\nHmm, keeping it concise. Let me draft a sentence that flows naturally. Start with the action: \"Continuously optimize...\" Then incorporate the elements without listing them separately. Avoid jargon to keep it plain English. Check the word count—should be tight. \n\nWait, does \"within safety constraints\" cover both adjusting and monitoring? Maybe rephrase to include all aspects without being redundant. Finally, end with the goal: \"improving efficiency and reporting gains.\" That should cover monitoring and reporting."
