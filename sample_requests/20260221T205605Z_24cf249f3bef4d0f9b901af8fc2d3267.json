They mentioned a multi-case customer support automation workflow for a retail chain. The key elements are triage, automatic resolution for simple issues, escalation for complex cases, and performance tracking.\n\nI need to make sure all these components are included in one concise sentence. Triage should come first to categorize issues. Then mention automatic fixes for simple ones, followed by escalation for harder cases. Performance tracking is also crucial to wrap it up. \n\nKeeping it under 40 words means being precise. Avoid jargon and keep it flow naturally. Maybe start with \"Design a workflow that...\" to directly address the request. Combine the steps smoothly without listing them bullet-style. \n\nCheck the word count: \"Design a workflow that triages customer issues, resolves simple ones automatically, escalates complex cases, and tracks performance metrics.\" That’s 20 words. All key points are covered, and it’s straightforward. No need for extra details since the user only wanted the prompt text."
