          "reasoning_content": "First, the task is to generate a single-sentence prompt in plain English. It should describe a high-stakes professional task in financial audits. The task requires structured analysis, identifying risks or compliance issues, proposing revisions, and delivering both technical and executive summaries.\n\nKey elements from the instruction:\n- Single sentence\n- Plain English\n- Describe a high-stakes professional task in financial audits\n- Requirements: structured analysis, identifying risks or compliance issues, proposing revisions, delivering technical and executive summaries\n- Output only the prompt text\n- Under 45 words\n\nI need to condense all these into one sentence that is under 45 words. Let me brainstorm the components.\n\nThe prompt should be for someone performing this task. For example, it could start with \"Analyze...\" or \"Conduct...\".\n\nPossible structure: \"Conduct a structured analysis of financial audits to identify risks and compliance issues, propose revisions, and deliver both technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nBut I need to emphasize \"high-stakes professional task\". So, maybe: \"In a high-stakes financial audit, perform structured analysis to identify risks or compliance issues, propose revisions, and provide technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nThat's 25 words. Let's count: \"In a high-stakes financial audit, perform structured analysis to identify risks or compliance issues, propose revisions, and provide technical and executive summaries.\" – Words: In, a, high-stakes, financial, audit, perform, structured, analysis, to, identify, risks, or, compliance, issues, propose, revisions, and, provide, technical, and, executive, summaries. That's 22 words.\n\nBut is it clear that it's a task requiring all these elements? The instruction says \"describing a high-stakes professional task\", so the prompt should describe what the task entails.\n\nI can make it more direct: \"Perform a structured financial audit analysis to identify risks and compliance issues, propose revisions, and deliver technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nThat's 18 words. Still, I need to include \"high-stakes\". So: \"Perform a high-stakes financial audit analysis to identify risks and compliance issues, propose revisions, and deliver technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nNow, 19 words. But \"financial audit analysis\" might be redundant. Perhaps \"audit analysis\" is fine.\n\nTo be precise: \"Conduct a structured analysis of a high-stakes financial audit to identify risks or compliance issues, propose revisions, and deliver both technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nWord count: Conduct, a, structured, analysis, of, a, high-stakes, financial, audit, to, identify, risks, or, compliance, issues, propose, revisions, and, deliver, both, technical, and, executive, summaries. That's 24 words.\n\nUnder 45 words, so it's fine. But let's ensure it's a single sentence. Yes, it is one sentence.\n\nI should output only the prompt text. So, no extra explanations.\n\nFinal check: The prompt should be in plain English, which it is. It describes the task clearly.\n\nI think this works. But let's see if there's a better way. The original instruction says \"generating one single-sentence plain-English prompt\", so I'm creating a prompt that someone might use to instruct another person to do this task.\n\nFor example, in a professional setting, the prompt might be: \"Analyze the financial audit for high-stakes risks and compliance issues, propose revisions, and summarize findings for both technical and executive audiences.\"\n\nThat's 22 words. But it doesn't explicitly say \"structured analysis\". However, \"analyze\" implies structure, but I should include it as per the requirements.\n\nRevised: \"Conduct a structured analysis of the financial audit to identify high-stakes risks and compliance issues, propose revisions, and deliver technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nWord count: 22 words. \"High-stakes\" is modifying \"risks\" but it should modify the task. In the context, \"high-stakes professional task\" means the audit itself is high-stakes. So, \"high-stakes financial audit\" is appropriate.\n\nI'll go with: \"Conduct a structured analysis of a high-stakes financial audit to identify risks or compliance issues, propose revisions, and deliver both technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nTo make it more imperative: \"Perform a structured analysis on a high-stakes financial audit to identify risks and compliance issues, propose revisions, and provide technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nBut \"provide\" might be less formal than \"deliver\". \"Deliver\" is used in the instruction, so I'll stick with \"deliver\".\n\nI think my first attempt is good. Let's confirm the word count.\n\n\"Conduct a structured analysis of a high-stakes financial audit to identify risks or compliance issues, propose revisions, and deliver both technical and executive summaries.\"\n\nWords: Conduct, a, structured, analysis, of, a, high-stakes, financial, audit, to, identify, risks, or, compliance, issues, propose, revisions, and, deliver, both, technical, and, executive, summaries. That's 24 words. Yes, under 45.\n\nI'll output this."
