          "reasoning_content": "First, the task is to generate a single-sentence prompt in plain English. The prompt should describe an operational optimization task for a wind-turbine farm. Specifically, it must include:\n\n- Analyzing live data\n- Adjusting parameters within safety constraints\n- Monitoring results\n- Reporting performance improvements\n\nThe output should be only the prompt text, and it must be under 40 words.\n\nI need to craft a concise sentence that covers all these elements. Let me list the key points to include:\n\n1. Operational optimization task for a wind-turbine farm.\n2. Analyze live data.\n3. Adjust parameters within safety constraints.\n4. Monitor results.\n5. Report performance improvements.\n\nI have to combine these into one sentence that is under 40 words. I'll start by drafting a sentence.\n\nDraft 1: \"Optimize wind farm operations by analyzing live data, adjusting parameters safely, monitoring outcomes, and reporting performance gains.\"\n\nLet me check the word count: \"Optimize wind farm operations by analyzing live data, adjusting parameters safely, monitoring outcomes, and reporting performance gains.\" That's 15 words. Good.\n\nBut I need to ensure it includes \"within safety constraints\" – I said \"safely,\" which might imply safety constraints, but I should be more explicit. Also, \"performance improvements\" is specified, so I used \"performance gains,\" which is similar.\n\nLet me revise to be more precise.\n\nDraft 2: \"To optimize a wind-turbine farm, analyze live data, adjust parameters within safety limits, monitor results, and report performance improvements.\"\n\nWord count: \"To optimize a wind-turbine farm, analyze live data, adjust parameters within safety limits, monitor results, and report performance improvements.\" That's 18 words. Still under 40.\n\nI should make it a clear prompt. Since it's a prompt, it might be instructive, like \"Describe a task that involves...\" but the instruction says \"describing an operational optimization task,\" so the prompt itself should describe the task.\n\nThe user said \"Generate one single-sentence plain-English prompt describing...\" so the output is the prompt text. So, I'm writing the prompt that describes the task.\n\nI think Draft 2 works well. Let me ensure it covers all elements:\n\n- Analyzing live data: \"analyze live data\" – yes.\n- Adjusting parameters within safety constraints: \"adjust parameters within safety limits\" – yes.\n- Monitoring results: \"monitor results\" – yes.\n- Reporting performance improvements: \"report performance improvements\" – yes.\n\nAlso, it's for a wind-turbine farm: \"wind-turbine farm\" – I used \"wind-turbine farm,\" which is fine. Alternatively, \"wind farm\" might be shorter, but I'll stick with \"wind-turbine farm\" for clarity.\n\nWord count: 18 words. Under 40. Perfect.\n\nI can make it even more concise if needed, but this seems good.\n\nFinal check: The sentence should be plain English, which it is. And it's a single sentence.\n\nSo, I'll go with Draft 2."
