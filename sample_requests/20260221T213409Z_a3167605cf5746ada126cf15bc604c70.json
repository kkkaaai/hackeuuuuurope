          "reasoning_content": "First, the prompt needs to be a single sentence in plain English. It should describe a realistic end-to-end operational workflow in the education domain. The workflow must involve coordinating multiple tools, resolving at least one constraint, updating systems, and delivering a final outcome. Also, the output should only be the prompt text, and it must be under 40 words.\n\nI need to brainstorm an example from the education domain. Think about common workflows: student enrollment, course scheduling, grading, resource allocation, etc.\n\nKey elements:\n- Coordinating multiple tools: This could include software like Student Information Systems (SIS), Learning Management Systems (LMS), email platforms, scheduling tools, etc.\n- Resolving at least one constraint: For example, room availability, teacher assignments, budget limits, time conflicts.\n- Updating systems: After resolving constraints, systems need to be updated to reflect changes.\n- Delivering a final outcome: Such as a finalized schedule, a completed enrollment process, a report generated.\n\nLet's formulate a prompt. It should be concise and under 40 words.\n\nExample idea: When a new student enrolls, the registrar must check course availability, assign classes, update the student database, and notify teachers and parents.\n\nBut I need to ensure it includes coordinating multiple tools, resolving constraints, etc.\n\nRefine: \"The registrar coordinates enrollment software, email, and scheduling tools to resolve class capacity conflicts, update student records, and finalize the student's course schedule.\"\n\nCount the words: \"The registrar coordinates enrollment software, email, and scheduling tools to resolve class capacity conflicts, update student records, and finalize the student's course schedule.\" – That's 20 words. It includes coordinating multiple tools (enrollment software, email, scheduling tools), resolving a constraint (class capacity conflicts), updating systems (student records), and delivering a final outcome (finalize the student's course schedule). This seems realistic in education.\n\nCheck if it's end-to-end operational workflow: Yes, from enrollment to final schedule.\n\nEnsure it's a single sentence: It is.\n\nUnder 40 words: Yes, 20 words.\n\nOutput only the prompt text: So, I'll just write that sentence.\n\nBut let me see if I can make it more precise. Another example: \"Academic advisors use scheduling systems and student portals to overcome time table clashes, update course registrations, and produce conflict-free timetables for students.\"\n\nWords: 18. This also works.\n\nI'll go with the first one for clarity."
