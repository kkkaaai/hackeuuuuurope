    "aeb_analysis_raw": "### AEB Analysis Results\n\n---\n\n**Step 1**  \n- **Step**: Analyze CRM data against sales targets to identify customer behavior patterns  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Combines multiple sub-actions (data retrieval, comparison, pattern recognition) and may involve branching/validation. Requires sequencing to process CRM data and sales targets.  \n- **Suggest**: Break into:  \n  1. Retrieve CRM data (AEB).  \n  2. Retrieve sales targets (AEB).  \n  3. Compare CRM data to sales targets (AEB).  \n  4. Generate behavior pattern report (AEB).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2**  \n- **Step**: Develop content strategy aligning audience segments with business objectives  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Involves branching (segment-specific decisions) and sequencing (strategy drafting, alignment checks). Requires subjective judgment.  \n- **Suggest**: Break into:  \n  1. Map audience segments to CRM insights (AEB).  \n  2. Align segments with sales targets (AEB).  \n  3. Draft strategy document (AEB).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3**  \n- **Step**: Create channel-specific content using approved templates  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Combines multiple outputs (blog, video, social media) and may involve branching (template variations).  \n- **Suggest**: Break into:  \n  1. Generate draft blog post (AEB).  \n  2. Generate draft video script (AEB).  \n  3. Generate social media assets (AEB).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4**  \n- **Step**: Schedule and publish content across all channels  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Combines scheduling and publishing (sequencing) and interacts with multiple system boundaries (website, YouTube, etc.).  \n- **Suggest**: Break into:  \n  1. Schedule content in channel management system (AEB).  \n  2. Publish to website (AEB).  \n  3. Publish to YouTube (AEB).  \n  4. Publish to social media platforms (AEB).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5**  \n- **Step**: Collect engagement metrics from all published content  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Aggregates data from multiple system boundaries (website, YouTube, etc.). Requires multiple API calls.  \n- **Suggest**: Break into:  \n  1. Retrieve website engagement metrics (AEB).  \n  2. Retrieve YouTube engagement metrics (AEB).  \n  3. Retrieve social media engagement metrics (AEB).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6**  \n- **Step**: Generate conversion analysis comparing engagement to sales objectives  \n- **Is AEB**: No  \n- **Reason**: Combines data merging (engagement + CRM + sales targets) and analysis. May involve branching (e.g., threshold checks).  \n- **Suggest**: Break into:  \n  1. Merge engagement metrics with CRM data (AEB).  \n  2. Compare merged data to sales targets (AEB).  \n  3. Generate conversion report (AEB).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7**  \n- **Step**: Update CRM records with campaign performance data  \n- **Is AEB**: Yes  \n- **Reason**: Single intent (CRM update), interacts with one system boundary (CRM API), no branching/sequencing.  \n- **Suggest**: N/A  \n\n--- \n\n### Summary of AEB-Compliant Steps  \nOnly **Step 7** meets all AEB criteria. All other steps require decomposition into smaller atomic actions.",
