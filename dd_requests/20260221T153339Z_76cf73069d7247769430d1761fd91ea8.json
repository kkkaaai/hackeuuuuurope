Parsing involves structured transformation (sequencing/branching logic).  \n**Suggestion:** Split into:  \n1A. Upload protocol document (AEB: Yes)  \n1B. Parse document into structured sections (AEB: Yes, if implemented as a single NLP API call)  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2**  \n**Step:** Uses: Input 2 (Regulatory Compliance Requirements) Action: Retrieve latest compliance rules via API and normalize format Produces: Standardized Compliance Rulebook Stores/Sends To: Compliance engine  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** Combines API retrieval (system boundary) with format normalization (internal processing).  \n**Suggestion:** Split into:  \n2A. Retrieve compliance rules via API (AEB: Yes)  \n2B. Normalize rule format (AEB: Yes, if implemented as a single transformation function)  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3**  \n**Step:** Uses: Input 5 (Historical Compliance Violation Database) Action: Query database for recurring violation patterns in similar trials Produces: Historical Risk Profile Stores/Sends To: Risk analysis module  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:** Single intent (query), interacts with database boundary, no branching/sequencing.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4**  \n**Step:** Uses: Input 2 (Regulatory Compliance Requirements) Action: Generate protocol-specific checklist using rulebook templates Produces: Compliance Checklist (Input 3) Stores/Sends To: Quality assurance system  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:** Single intent (checklist generation), interacts with template system, no branching.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5**  \n**Step:** Uses: Parsed Protocol Dataset, Compliance Checklist Action: Automated rule-based compliance gap analysis Produces: Initial Compliance Gap Summary Stores/Sends To: Review interface  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:** Single intent (gap analysis), implemented as a rules engine API call.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6**  \n**Step:** Uses: Input 4 (SME Feedback) Action: Integrate expert annotations into gap analysis Produces: Finalized Compliance Gap Analysis Stores/Sends To: Reporting module  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:** Single intent (integration), implemented as a merge/overlay API.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7**  \n**Step:** Uses: Finalized Compliance Gap Analysis, Historical Risk Profile Action: Prioritize risks using severity scoring matrix Produces: Risk Prioritization Matrix Stores/Sends To: Revision planning tool  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:** Single intent (prioritization), implemented as a scoring matrix API.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 8**  \n**Step:** Uses: Risk Prioritization Matrix Action: Generate technical assessment report with revision rationale Produces: Technical Compliance Assessment Report Stores/Sends To: Document management system  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:** Single intent (report generation), implemented as a templated report API.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 9**  \n**Step:** Uses: Risk Prioritization Matrix Action: Create executive summary with plain-language risk summaries Produces: Executive Summary Document Stores/Sends To: Stakeholder portal  \n**Is AEB:** Yes  \n**Reason:** Single intent (summary generation), implemented as a natural-language generation API.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 10**  \n**Step:** Uses: Technical Compliance Assessment Report Action: Implement tracked changes in protocol draft Produces: Proposed Protocol Revisions Stores/Sends To: Version control repository  \n**Is AEB:** No  \n**Reason:** Implies document editing logic (branching/sequencing for tracked changes).  \n**Suggestion:** Split into:  \n10A. Apply tracked changes to protocol draft (AEB: Yes, if using a document diff API)  \n10B. Save revised protocol to version control (AEB: Yes)  \n\n--- \n\n### Summary of Non-AEB Steps  \n- **Steps 1, 2, and 10** require decomposition into smaller AEBs.  \n- All other steps meet AEB criteria as written.",
